M5910_S0010_G0000_001_kj=Hmm? Haven't seen your face around.
M5910_S0010_G0010_001_toolshop=Who are you?
M5910_S0010_G0020_001_adjuster=......
M5910_S0010_G0040_001_resiwomanB=You... I've seen you somewhere before.
M5910_S0010_G0050_001_resimanA=Hey, hey. Are those wounds okay?
M5910_S0100_G0000_001_pascal=Eeeeek! Help... Please help me!
M5910_S0100_G0010_001_a2=Machine Lifeforms... fighting each other?
M5910_S0100_G0020_001_pascal=Thank you very much.
M5910_S0100_G0030_001_a2=You're a Machine Lifeform too...
M5910_S0100_G0040_001_pascal=No! I have no intention of fighting you!
M5910_S0100_G0050_001_pascal=My name is Pascal. I am a Machine Lifeform who dislikes fighting.
M5910_S0100_G0060_001_a2=...So what?
M5910_S0100_G0070_001_a2=Machine Lifeforms don't have souls. They're just slaughtering machines.
M5910_S0100_G0080_001_a2=I'll have you atone... for the sin of killing so many of my comrades.
M5910_S0100_G0090_001_pascal=Is that so... It cannot be helped, then.
M5910_S0100_G0100_001_pascal=If that... will save you.
M5910_S0100_G0110_001_sele=Do not forgive Pascal.
M5910_S0100_G0120_001_sele=Let Pascal live.
M5910_S0100_G0130_001_pascal=...You aren't going to kill me?
M5910_S0100_G0140_001_a2=Shut up... Get out of here before I change my mind.
M5910_S0100_G0150_001_pascal=...You are,
M5910_S0100_G0155_001_pascal=............
M5910_S0100_G0160_001_pascal=...No, it is nothing.
M5910_S0100_G0170_001_pascal=Thank you very much.
M5910_S0200_G0090_001_ane=You're Number Two... You're alive.
M5910_S0200_G0100_001_a2=Long time no see, Anemone.
M5910_S0200_G0110_001_ane=I see... You survived. I'm glad.
M5910_S0200_G0120_001_ane=...Everyone who fought with us back then is dead.
M5910_S0200_G0130_001_ane=Number 21... I killed her with my own hands...
M5910_S0200_G0140_001_a2=......
M5910_S0200_G0150_001_a2=...Sorry about that.
M5910_S0200_G0160_001_ane=No...
M5910_S0200_G0170_001_ane=That's right! Number Two, there was a YoRHa named 2B who looked exactly like you. She was—
M5910_S0200_G0180_001_a2=Dead.
M5910_S0200_G0190_001_ane=What?
M5910_S0200_G0200_001_a2=I killed 2B. She was contaminated by a logic virus.
M5910_S0200_G0210_001_ane=...I see.
M5910_S0200_G0220_001_ane=Feel free to use this camp as you like. As for explaining the facilities...
M5910_S0200_G0230_001_a2=Not necessary.
M5910_S0200_G0240_001_a2=Her memories... they remain in this sword.
M5910_S0200_G0250_001_ane=...Understood.
M5910_S0200_G0260_001_ane=You can use the room 2B used.
M5910_S0200_G0270_001_ane=I'm the leader here. I'll let everyone know.
