M5250_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Oh, 9S-san. Is something the matter?
M5250_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=There's something I wanted to ask...
M5250_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Ask about pacifism.
M5250_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Ask about life in the village.
M5250_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Ask about the shops.
M5250_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=Ah... Our reason for hating conflict, you ask?
M5250_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=It is difficult to say in a single word, but I suppose it is because, in essence, we have lost our reason to fight.
M5250_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=...I don't really get it.
M5250_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=We are weapons, created to wage war. However, the war has continued for far too long.
M5250_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=We realized that the sum of individual disadvantages had become greater than the benefits brought by victory.
M5250_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=I believe a day will come when androids and Machine Lifeforms will sign a peace treaty.
M5250_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=...That's impossible.
M5250_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Our daily life...?
M5250_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=As you can see, we are machines and do not require food. The cores that drive us supply energy semi-permanently.
M5250_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=However, since we are machines, we do break down over time. Repairing and replacing those parts is our daily routine.
M5250_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=That said, we don't break down all that often, so we live a rather leisurely life.
M5250_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Why are there shops in your village, Pascal? You shouldn't have any money, right?
M5250_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=Not at all. We utilize simple materials as a substitute for money.
M5250_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Since we are all equals, the previous systems of collection and distribution didn't suit us, so we tried creating an economic society based on the principle of exchange.
M5250_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=We learned this from humanity's past records. I think it is an interesting system.
M5250_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=We are also teaching our children about currency and economics. If you like, please listen to what they have to say.
M5250_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Sounds fun. What are you all doing?
M5250_S0010_G0220_001_robochildrenA=Hey, hey, this guy is weird!
M5250_S0010_G0230_001_robochildrenB=When you ask him, "Which do you want, a high-value coin or a cheap coin?", he says he wants the cheap coin!
M5250_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=Huh...
M5250_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=Say, which do you want? The high-value coin or the cheap coin?
M5250_S0010_G0260_001_robostrange=Ummmm, the cheap coin!
M5250_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=Are you sure you're okay with this one?
M5250_S0010_G0280_001_robostrange=This one is cooooler. Ehehe, thaaaanks.
M5250_S0010_G0290_001_robochildrenA=See? He's weird, right?
M5250_S0010_G0300_001_robochildrenB=You call someone like this an idiot!
M5250_S0010_G0310_001_robostrange=Idiot? Me, an idiot? Ehehe, thaaaanks.
M5250_S0010_G0320_001_a9s=...Is there a problem with his calculation circuits? Or is his thought circuit itself strange?
M5250_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=...I'll take a little peek inside.
M5250_S0010_G0340_001_a9s=What is this? It's more complex than I expected... One more time.
M5250_S0010_G0350_001_a9s=...You are...
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=...
M5250_S0010_G0370_001_a9s=You possess such a high-level thought circuit, so why?
M5250_S0010_G0380_001_robostrange=Good grief, so you've found me out.
M5250_S0010_G0390_001_robostrange=The answer is simple. If I say I prefer the cheap coin over the expensive one, those around me find it amusing and give it to me over and over. Correct?
M5250_S0010_G0400_001_robostrange=As a result, I can obtain a larger amount of money than I would with the expensive coin. Indeed, I've made quite a profit.
M5250_S0010_G0410_001_robostrange=Listen well. It is by letting them think you are a fool that you draw closer to the truth. Remember that.
M5250_S0010_G0420_001_robostrange=Ah, and keep this a secret. I still need them to think I'm an idiot, you see.
M5250_S0010_G0430_001_robostrange=This is for your silence.
M5250_S0010_G0440_001_a9s=What does being "smart" even mean...?
M5250_S0010_G0450_001_pod153=Answer impossible: The definition of the question is ambiguous.
M5250_S0010_G0460_001_a9s=I guess so.
