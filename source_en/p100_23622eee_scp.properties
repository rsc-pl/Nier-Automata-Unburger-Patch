M1030_S0120_G0010_001_n02=It'S fUN! IT's fUN!
M1030_S0120_G0011_001_a2b=This is...
M1030_S0120_G0012_001_a9s=How should I put it... it's a bizarre atmosphere...
M1030_S0120_G0020_001_n02=LeT's shARe! OuR jOY!
M1030_S0120_G0020_300_a9s=I wonder where this passageway connects to...
M1030_S0120_G0030_001_n02=LeT's mEEt!
M1030_S0120_G0030_300_a9s=We might be able to get to the inner area via another route.
M1030_S0120_G0040_300_a9s=I think we can proceed deeper from somewhere...
M1030_S0120_G0050_001_a9s=The gate here... doesn't look like it'll open.
M1030_S0120_G0050_300_a9s=Also, this is about the only place we haven't investigated.
M1030_S0120_G0060_001_a9s=I wonder if we can proceed from some other path...
M1030_S0120_G0060_300_a9s=The Resistance signal is being broadcast from the direction of that building.
M1030_S0120_G0061_001_a9s=Let's look and see if there isn't a route we can take.
M1030_S0120_G0070_001_n02=Let'S dANce! LeT'S dAnCE!
M1030_S0120_G0070_300_a2b=...What is this?

M1030_S0120_G0080_300_pod042=Answer: Playground equipment built by humanity.\nSomething to experience thrills by moving at high speed on rails.
M1030_S0120_G0090_001_n02=LeT'S pLAy! LeT'S pLAy!
M1030_S0120_G0090_300_pod042=It was also called a "Screaming Machine."
M1030_S0120_G0100_001_n02=Let'S siNG! LeT'S sINg!
M1030_S0120_G0100_300_a9s=Humans sure are weird creatures...
M1030_S0120_G0110_001_n02=LeT'S pLAy! LeT'S pLAy!
M1030_S0120_G0120_001_n02=LeT'S pLAy! LeT'S pLAy!
M1030_S0120_G0121_001_a2b=To proceed past here...
M1030_S0120_G0122_001_a9s=Let's check if there isn't a route we can advance through.
M1030_S0120_G0150_001_a9s=A large-scale armed Machine Lifeform like this...
M1030_S0120_G0160_001_a9s=If we let it go, it looks like it'll be trouble later. Let's defeat it!
M1030_S0120_G0170_001_a9s=That tank... is it okay to leave it be?
M1030_S0120_G0180_001_a2b=If there is no harm, fighting is a waste of time.
M5920_S0060_G0000_001_a9s=...By the way, 2B.
M5920_S0060_G0010_001_a2b=What?
M5920_S0060_G0020_001_a9s=Close who know me well call me "Nines", but...
M5920_S0060_G0030_001_a2b=Is that so.
M5920_S0060_G0040_001_a9s=How about you, 2B?
M5920_S0060_G0050_001_a2b=What?
M5920_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=I mean, it's okay for you to call me "Nines", you know?
M5920_S0060_G0070_001_a2b=Not yet.
M5920_S0060_G0080_001_a9s=...I, see.
