M1060_S0080_G0000_001_a9s=2B. There are interception cannons for coastal defense set up here.
M1060_S0080_G0010_001_a9s=Even that monster... if we hit it with physical shells from close range, we should be able to deal damage without being affected by the EMP!
M1060_S0080_G0020_001_a2b=Roger.
M1060_S0080_G0030_001_a9s=I'll assist with targeting!
M1060_S0080_G0040_001_a2b=Ngh... The enemy's outer wall is too thick for these shells...
M1060_S0080_G0050_001_a9s=2B! You have to attack its insides directly!
M1060_S0080_G0060_001_a2b=Directly... I see!
M1060_S0080_G0070_001_a9s=That's right. Fire the shells right into that thing's mouth!
