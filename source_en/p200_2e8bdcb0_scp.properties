M1040_S0545_S0000_001_cmd=From Command to all YoRHa units.
M1040_S0545_S0001_001_a2b=This is...
M1040_S0545_S0002_001_pod042=A sinkhole, caused by the collapse of a subterranean cavern.
M1040_S0545_S0003_001_a9s=Why would there be such a huge cavern down here...?
M1040_S0545_S0010_001_cmd=We have confirmed signals from the Aliens, who have remained undiscovered for hundreds of years.
M1040_S0545_S0020_001_cmd=As you are aware, the Aliens serve as the Command Tower for the Machine Lifeforms.
M1040_S0545_S0030_001_cmd=If we annihilate the Aliens, this long war will finally come to an end.
M1040_S0545_S0040_001_cmd=The Technology Department is currently analyzing the source of the transmission,
M1040_S0545_S0050_001_cmd=but information is insufficient.
M1040_S0545_S0060_001_cmd=All YoRHa units on the surface are to prioritize intelligence gathering on this matter.
M1040_S0545_S0070_001_cmd=We must not let this opportunity pass.
M1040_S0545_S0080_001_cmd=...Glory to Mankind.
M1040_S0545_S0090_300_a9s=What... was that weird enemy?
M1040_S0550_G0001_001_a9s=Based on Command's intel, I've projected the signal's origin. It's marked on the map now.
M1040_S0550_G0010_001_a9s=But... it looks like it's coming from pretty deep underground.
M1040_S0550_G0020_001_a2b=We'll find out when we get there.
M1040_S0550_G0021_001_a2b=Probably.
M1040_S0550_G0030_001_a9s=You know, 2B... you have a surprisingly rough side to you.
M1040_S0550_G0120_300_a9s=2B. Let's head down into the sinkhole where we got the signal.
M1040_S0550_G0130_300_pod042=Report: Heavy encryption. Access denied.
