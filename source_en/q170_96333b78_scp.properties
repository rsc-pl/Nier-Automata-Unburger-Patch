M5170_S0000_G0000_300_op60=Regarding the repair of the transporter, I'm counting on you.
M5170_S0010_G0000_001_op60=From Operator 6O to 2B-san. Can you hear me?
M5170_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=I hear you.
M5170_S0010_G0020_001_op60=It seems the transporter installed in the City Ruins has malfunctioned.
M5170_S0010_G0030_001_op60=At this rate, it'll cause problems for surface activities,
M5170_S0010_G0040_001_op60=so please repair it whenever you have time.
M5170_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0010_G0060_001_op60=I've emailed you the details. Please take care of it.
M5170_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Should the transporter be unusable, significant defects will arise in data uploads and other functions.
M5170_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Recommendation: Immediate restoration of the transporter.
M5170_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0020_G0030_001_pod042=Report: Hostile Machine Lifeforms detected in the transporter's vicinity. Jamming radio waves confirmed.
M5170_S0020_G0040_001_pod042=Deduction: The transporter's malfunction is caused by enemy jamming radio waves.
M5170_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of the aforementioned Machine Lifeforms.
M5170_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=Is that... all of them.
M5170_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=Just in case, let's check the transporter's main unit as well.
M5170_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=Functionality seems fine.
M5170_S0030_G0021_001_pod042=Report: Transporter's normal operation confirmed.
M5170_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=This is YoRHa Unit 2B. Communicating with Bunker Operator 6O.
M5170_S0030_G0040_001_op60=Ah! 2B-san. Good work.
M5170_S0030_G0050_001_a2b=The designated transporter has been restored. The cause was jamming radio waves from enemy Machine Lifeforms.
M5170_S0030_G0060_001_op60=Roger that! Thank you very much.
M5170_S0030_G0070_001_op60=I'll share this information with Command!
M5170_S0030_G0080_001_op60=Also, I'll be emailing you the data for a special reward.
M5170_S0030_G0090_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0030_G0100_001_op60=...Still, it must be nice~, 2B-san.
M5170_S0030_G0110_001_op60=N-no, I'm sure combat missions are tough!
M5170_S0030_G0120_001_op60=It's just... I'm a little envious that you get to see the beautiful scenery on the surface.
M5170_S0030_G0130_001_op60=I keep thinking it would be nice if I could go down there someday, too.
M5170_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=...I see.
M5170_S0030_G0150_001_op60=I was just making useless small talk. I'm sorry!
M5170_S0030_G0160_001_op60=Well then, excuse me!
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Mail reception notification from Access Point.
