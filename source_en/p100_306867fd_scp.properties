M1010_S0050_G0040_300_a9s=Vegetation encroachment has advanced quite a bit here,\nbut back then it must have been a rather large city.
M1010_S0060_G0000_001_a9s=So this is the Resistance Camp...
M1010_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=First, let's try asking the leader for information.
M1010_S0060_G0020_001_ane=You're...
M1010_S0060_G0025_001_ane=Number Two...
M1010_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=Huh? Do you know 2B?
M1010_S0060_G0040_001_ane=...No, I received a message from the Bunker.
M1010_S0060_G0050_001_ane=I'm Anemone.
M1010_S0060_G0060_001_ane=I manage the Android Resistance in this whole area.
M1010_S0060_G0070_001_ane=I've heard the story from the Bunker. Seems you were assigned to investigate this area.
M1010_S0060_G0080_001_ane=The others would know more about the intel than I do.
M1010_S0060_G0090_001_ane=You don't need to go through me, so ask them as you please.
M1010_S0060_G0100_001_ane=You'll probably use the Weapons Shop and Item Shop frequently, so it might be good to at least say hello.
M1010_S0060_G0110_001_ane=Also, there's a fellow near the entrance wearing a Machine Lifeform head...
M1010_S0060_G0120_001_ane=She's a weird, but knowledgeable one, so you should try asking her various things.
M1020_S0005_G0000_001_ane=That's right. I have one request for you as well.
M1020_S0005_G0010_001_ane=It seems many vicious Machine Lifeforms are appearing in the Desert Zone lately.
M1020_S0005_G0020_001_ane=It's a phenomenon that hasn't happened before, so something might be happening.
M1020_S0005_G0030_001_ane=I hear you YoRHa troops are also good at investigation.
M1020_S0005_G0040_001_ane=Could you investigate the cause of the abnormality in the Desert Zone?
M1020_S0005_G0050_001_ane=Help.
M1020_S0005_G0060_001_ane=Don't help.
M1020_S0005_G0070_001_ane=Is that so. Thank you.
M1020_S0005_G0080_001_ane=I'll contact our comrades in the desert.
M1020_S0005_G0090_001_ane=Please, be careful.
M1020_S0005_G0100_001_ane=I see...  Talk to me again, if you feel like it.
M5920_S0100_G0000_001_op60=From Operator 6O to 2B-san. It is time for regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0010_001_a2b=This is 2B. No abnormalities.
M5920_S0100_G0020_001_op60=That is good. Is the weather on Earth good today?
M5920_S0100_G0030_001_a2b=No problems... Is that information related to the operation?
M5920_S0100_G0040_001_op60=No no, not that. I just thought, if the weather is good, maybe you'd feel good... or something.
M5920_S0100_G0050_001_a2b=Whether I feel good or not has no relation to the operation.
M5920_S0100_G0060_001_op60=Haha... That's just like you, 2B-san.
M5920_S0100_G0070_001_op60=Well then, later!
M5920_S0100_G0320_001_op210=From Operator 21O to 9S. Conducting regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0330_001_a9s=Yees. This is 9S. No abnormalitieees. Man, the weather is good too...
M5920_S0100_G0340_001_op210=Report of no abnormalities. Understood.
M5920_S0100_G0350_001_op210=Weather information is not necessary. That is all.
M5920_S0100_G0360_001_a9s=Man, the Operator-san is stiff as always...
M5920_S0100_G0370_001_a9s=I feel like that's her good point though.
M6090_S0010_G0015_300_kj=Ah, a new face? \nYou should go talk to the Captain over there.
M6090_S0010_G0045_300_toolshop=Someone from YoRHa? First, please run it by the Leader.\nThere are all sorts of... customs here.
M6090_S0010_G0125_300_resiman=The one running this place is the Leader, Anemone-neesan.\nYou should go greet her first.
M6090_S0010_G0145_300_resiman=...Haven't seen your face before.
M6090_S0010_G0165_300_resiman=Oops. Did you go to met the Leader?
M6090_S0010_G0195_300_resiman=............
M6090_S0010_G0255_300_resiwoman=Anemone-san over there is the leader of this camp.
M6090_S0010_G0285_300_resiwoman=Ah, hello! You're from the YoRHa troops, right! We've been waiting for you! Did you meet the leader, Anemone-san? You haven't met her? Or did you meet her?
M6090_S0010_G0415_300_resiwoman=Hi there. If you're going to investigate various things in this camp, could you run it by the top first?
M6090_S0010_G0435_300_resiwoman=...Umm... who... are you?
M6090_S0010_G0455_300_resiwoman=The leader is in the back of the tent.
M6090_S0010_G0485_300_resiman=Are you a new face too?
M6090_S0010_G0515_300_resiman=Don't end up being carried into this infirmary, okay...?
M6090_S0010_G0535_300_resiman=Hey hey. Little missies. First, run it by the leader, Anemone-san.\nThat's the style here.
M6090_S0010_G0555_300_resiwoman=You're new here? Nice to meet you.
M6090_S0010_G0575_300_resiman=...
M6090_S0010_G0605_300_resiwoman=I think the leader, Anemone-san, is in the tent in the plaza.
M6090_S0010_G0625_300_resiwoman=There are various things we can't talk about to outsiders...
M6090_S0010_G0645_300_resiman=Hmm? A new YoRHa person...
M6090_S0010_G0665_300_resiman=Huh? You can't come this deep inside without the leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0685_300_resiman=Sorry. There's a rule that you have to run it by the leader.
M6090_S0010_G0705_300_resiman=Among the camps in various regions, the rules here are particularly strict.\nPlease start by getting the leader's approval.
M6090_S0010_G0735_300_resiman=Ah, the leader isn't here, you know?
M6090_S0010_G0785_300_resiman=Hmm? You're not allowed to wander around a place like this\nwithout the leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0805_300_ys=Ah, a new face. You should go ask the leader, Anemone, first.
M6090_S0010_G0835_300_bs=Ah, are you from the YoRHa troops?\nCould you please meet the leader, Anemone-san, first?
M6090_S0091_G0001_300_hennawresi=You guys, are you new faces from the YoRHa troops?\nIf so, you should go meet the leader here.
