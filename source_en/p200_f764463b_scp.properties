M1060_S0120_G0000_101_pascal=That giant Machine Lifeform is a weapon discarded in the past.
M1060_S0120_G0010_101_pascal=It was developed for Android annihilation, but it became uncontrollable...
M1060_S0120_G0020_101_pascal=At that time, I was also incorporated into the Machine Lifeform network, so I remember it, but...
M1060_S0120_G0030_101_pascal=As soon as it landed, it went berserk and began attacking friend and foe alike.
M1060_S0120_G0040_101_pascal=But, in the end, we were also unable to stop the rampage...
M1060_S0120_G0050_101_pascal=It was dumped into the deep sea, but it seems it is attempting to land again.
M1060_S0120_G0060_101_a2b=Is that so...
M1060_S0120_G0070_101_a9s=...2B!
M1060_S0120_G0080_101_a9s=I just thought of something!
M1060_S0120_G0090_101_a9s=Please hold off the monster here!
M1060_S0120_G0100_101_a2b=...Eh!?
M1060_S0120_G0110_101_a9s=I'm counting on you!
M1060_S0120_G0120_101_pod042=9S has withdrawn from the battle line.
M1060_S0120_G0130_101_pod042=Proposal: Register as a deserter to Command.
M1060_S0120_G0140_101_a2b=No!
M1060_S0120_G0150_101_a2b=...I'm sure 9S has an idea.
M1060_S0120_G0160_101_a9s=2B!
M1060_S0120_G0170_101_a9s=I'm going to try and see if I can use the missiles that were scheduled to be loaded onto the aircraft carrier.
M1060_S0120_G0180_101_a9s=So that the control isn't jammed,
M1060_S0120_G0190_101_a9s=Please destroy the EMP attack unit on the enemy's back!
M1060_S0120_G0200_101_a2b=Roger.
