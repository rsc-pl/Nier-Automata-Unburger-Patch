M1030_S0400_G0250_001_a2b=What's that...?
M1030_S0400_G0260_001_a9s=Ah, so you've never seen one before, 2B.
M1030_S0400_G0270_001_a9s=It's launching supplies from the surface up to the Bunker and the human bases on the moon.
M1030_S0400_G0280_001_a9s=There aren't any materials or fuel in space, after all.
M1030_S0400_G0290_001_a2b=I see.
M1030_S0400_G0300_001_a2b=...Why don't the Machine Lifeforms, or the aliens that created them, attack the Bunker directly?
M1030_S0400_G0310_001_a2b=They're supposed to have come from space in the first place...
M1030_S0400_G0320_001_a9s=There's a lot of debate about the reason for that, but...
M1030_S0400_G0330_001_a9s=no one's reached a conclusion.
M1030_S0400_G0340_001_a9s=It's hard to know what the aliens are thinking.
