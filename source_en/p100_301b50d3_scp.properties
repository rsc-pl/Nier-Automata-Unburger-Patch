M0010_S0220_G1030_101_a9s=2B-san!
M0010_S0220_G1040_101_a2b=What?
M0010_S0220_G1050_101_a9s=I'll transfer the map data I surveyed earlier.
M0010_S0220_G1060_101_a2b=Roger.
M0010_S0220_G1110_101_a9s=2B-san. I... am happy.
M0010_S0220_G1120_101_a2b=About what?
M0010_S0220_G1130_101_a9s=We Scanner types usually do preliminary investigations alone.
M0010_S0220_G1140_101_a9s=So, getting to work with someone else is... fun.
M0010_S0220_G1150_101_a2b=...Possessing emotions is prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G1160_101_a9s=Ah... I'm sorry!
M0010_S0220_G1170_101_a2b=Also...
M0010_S0220_G1180_101_a2b=You don't need to add "-san".
M0010_S0220_G1190_101_a9s=...Eh?
M0010_S0220_G1200_101_a2b=Honorifics are unnecessary for my name.
M0010_S0220_G1210_101_a9s=...Understood. 2B!
M0010_S0220_G1220_101_a2b=It is vast... this ruin.
M0010_S0220_G1230_101_a9s=Apparently, this place used to be a weapons factory for humanity long ago.
M0010_S0220_G1240_101_a9s=Though now, it's completely full of Machine Lifeforms...
M0010_S0220_G1250_101_a9s=It seems the enemy is reusing this factory to mass-produce Machine Lifeforms.
M0010_S0220_G1260_101_a2b=They'll spawn infinitely unless we annihilate them...
M0010_S0220_G1266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G1267_101_a9s=It's using data from the Old World to speak random things.
M0010_S0220_G1268_101_a9s=There's no meaning to what Machine Lifeforms do.
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=Ah, birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Perhaps due to environmental changes, it seems there are\nmore animals and plants than there were in the Old World.
M0010_S0700_G1031_101_a2b=That is...
M0010_S0700_G1040_101_a2b=I explored the factory, but I couldn't discover any weapon resembling the target.
M0010_S0700_G1060_101_a9s=Maybe they moved it to another location.
M0010_S0700_G1061_101_a9s=There should be another facility beyond that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G1062_101_a9s=It's a little far, but shall we try moving there?
M0010_S0700_G1070_101_a9s=But it's rare for headquarters to miscalculate the enemy's predicted position.
M0010_S0700_G1080_101_a2b=No.
M0010_S0700_G1090_101_a2b=I wonder about that...
M0010_S0733_G0000_201_a9s=2B!? What happened!!
M0010_S0733_G0005_001_a2b=
M0010_S0733_G0010_201_pod153=Appears to have entered combat with enemy Large-Scale Weapon.
M0010_S0733_G0020_201_a9s=I have to provide support... Let's hurry!
