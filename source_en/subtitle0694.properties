M1090_S2000_H0030_001_a2b=...It's always... like this...
M1090_S2000_H0040_001_a2b=They... still remain...?
M1090_S2000_H0050_001_a2b=Such... machines...
M1090_S2000_H0060_001_a2b=...Is this... a transmission...?
M1090_S2000_H0070_001_a2b=The data signals are... resonating with each other...
M1090_S2000_H0080_001_a9s=
M1090_S2000_H0090_001_a9s=W-Wait a second! 2B!!
M1090_S2000_H0100_001_a2b=...You are...
M1090_S2000_H0110_001_a9s=It seems I left my personal data on the Machine Lifeform side.
M1090_S2000_H0120_001_a9s=Before I knew it, my self was reformed on the surrounding network.
M1090_S2000_H0130_001_a9s=Having multiple selves integrated like this is a valuable experience so I want to record it, but I can't access the storage area yet, so for now
M1090_S2000_H0140_001_a9s=after multiplexing and saving it to the enemy memory around here, when I can return to my own body...
M1090_S2000_H0150_001_a2b=9S...

M1090_S2000_H0180_001_a9s=Thus, the final battle revolving around Adam and Eve ended.
M1090_S2000_H0190_001_a2b=What is it that separates Machine Lifeforms and us androids?
M1090_S2000_H0200_001_a9s=This battle will likely have a great effect on the outcome of the war.
M1090_S2000_H0210_001_a2b=Robots that came to possess will and emotion.
M1090_S2000_H0220_001_a9s=The battle for 2B and myself will still continue for a while after this, but...
M1090_S2000_H0230_001_a2b=The final scream they squeezed out on the verge of death.
M1090_S2000_H0240_001_a9s=That is, again, another story.
M1090_S2000_H0250_001_a2b=Even now, it remains within me.
