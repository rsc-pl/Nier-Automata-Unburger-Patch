M6090_S0091_G0000_300_hennawresi=Ah, a member of the YoRHa squad.
M6090_S0091_G0010_300_hennawresi=Hm? ...This thing on my head?
M6090_S0091_G0020_300_hennawresi=This is an electromagnetic wave-blocking device. I wear it on my head to restrict unnecessary information from the outside world.
M6090_S0091_G0030_300_hennawresi=...That's a lie, though.
M6090_S0091_G0040_300_hennawresi=So, what can I do for you? Something on your mind?
M6090_S0091_G0050_300_hennawresi=It was fun talking... Come back anytime, okay?
M6090_S0091_G0060_300_hennawresi=If you've got any worries, I'm happy to listen.
M6090_S0091_G0070_300_hennawresi=Well then, see you around.
M6090_S0091_G0080_300_hennawresi=Ah... Sounds like you YoRHa folks have had it rough.
M6090_S0091_G0090_300_hennawresi=Now that the Bunker is gone, you won't be supplied with new bodies.\nThat means if you die, you can't be "Recovered."
M6090_S0091_G0100_300_hennawresi=If you die, that's it. It's the end.\nSo I'd recommend saving as often as you possibly can...
M6090_S0091_G0110_300_sele=How do I save?
M6090_S0091_G0120_300_sele=What's an Access Point?
M6090_S0091_G0130_300_sele=What should I do if I die?
M6090_S0091_G0140_300_sele=Where should I go from here?
M6090_S0091_G0150_300_sele=I'm getting 3D motion sickness...
M6090_S0091_G0160_300_sele=This game is too hard...
M6090_S0091_G0170_300_sele=Request to unlock "that thing."
M6090_S0091_G0180_300_sele=I don't have any worries.
M6090_S0091_G0190_300_hennawresi=First off, I want you to remember that this game doesn't have an auto-save function.
M6090_S0091_G0191_300_hennawresi=To save, you'll need to activate that Access Point over there.
M6090_S0091_G0192_300_hennawresi=Once a terminal is active, you should be able to save anywhere in its vicinity.
M6090_S0091_G0200_300_hennawresi=When the antenna icon in the top right of your screen is active, you can perform a Quick Save from the System Menu.
M6090_S0091_G0201_300_hennawresi=You can also use the Access Point here to return to your YoRHa squad's satellite base.
M6090_S0091_G0202_300_hennawresi=The other Access Points are still under maintenance, but transfers should become available in time.
M6090_S0091_G0210_300_hennawresi=I'll say it again: there's no auto-save, so don't forget.
M6090_S0091_G0220_300_hennawresi=The area where the antenna is effective is limited, but you should be able to expand the save-enabled area by activating more Access Points.
M6090_S0091_G0230_300_hennawresi=Just in case, I'll say it one last time: there is no auto-save in this game. Okay?
M6090_S0091_G0240_300_hennawresi=An Access Point is a facility set up for members of the YoRHa squad.
M6090_S0091_G0250_300_hennawresi=To be specific, it's that thing over there.
M6090_S0091_G0260_300_hennawresi=At an Access Point, you can do things like save your data or receive mail.
M6090_S0091_G0270_300_hennawresi=Outside of the camp, they're disguised as the wreckage of old vending machines.
M6090_S0091_G0280_300_hennawresi=They have a bunch of other functions, too... but well, you'll figure it out as you use them.
M6090_S0091_G0290_300_hennawresi=Sometimes you'll find terminals that are unusable because they've been attacked by enemies. When that happens, you should just eliminate the hostiles.
M6090_S0091_G0300_300_hennawresi=As you walk around, you should see a minimap in the bottom right corner.\nThe <MAP_GOAL> marker on it shows your next destination.
M6090_S0091_G0310_300_hennawresi=Basically, just head for the red marker and you'll probably be fine.
M6090_S0091_G0320_300_hennawresi=Now that's a good, philosophical question.
M6090_S0091_G0330_300_hennawresi=Immediately after a YoRHa unit is destroyed, only her memory data is transferred to a new "Body."
M6090_S0091_G0340_300_hennawresi=However, items and the like aren't transferred. So if you die, you need to recover the Plug-in Chips from your previous corpse.
M6090_S0091_G0350_300_hennawresi=If you die again before you can recover them, those Plug-in Chips will be lost for good. So be careful.
M6090_S0091_G0360_300_hennawresi=Long story short... "Recover your corpse immediately."
M6090_S0091_G0370_300_hennawresi=Ah, for any system-related questions, you should probably ask the maintenance specialist over there.
M6090_S0091_G0375_300_hennawresi=He handles everything from body maintenance to Pod adjustments.
M6090_S0091_G0380_300_hennawresi=You can change the game's difficulty anytime from the System Menu.\nThe gameplay experience is different for each difficulty, so you might want to try them out.
M6090_S0091_G0390_300_hennawresi="EASY" weakens enemies and lets you equip "Auto Chips."\nPressing <KC_LOCKON> will activate auto-attacks and auto-evasion.
M6090_S0091_G0400_300_hennawresi="NORMAL" is, well, a normal difficulty.
M6090_S0091_G0410_300_hennawresi=On "HARD," enemies are stronger and you can't use "Lock-on."
M6090_S0091_G0420_300_hennawresi=On "VERY HARD," "Lock-on" is disabled, and on top of that,\nenemy attack power is boosted to an unbelievable degree.
M6090_S0091_G0430_300_hennawresi=...It's a frankly insane difficulty, but it seems like the real daredevils choose that one.
M6090_S0091_G0431_300_hennawresi=And hey, just between us, I hear there are some unlisted combat techniques hidden in "DATA" -> "Tutorial."
M6090_S0091_G0432_300_hennawresi=If you're ever bored to death, you might want to take a peek.
M6090_S0091_G0440_300_hennawresi=Ah, it's you.
M6090_S0091_G0450_300_hennawresi=Truth is, I've started a little side business I can't really tell people about...
M6090_S0091_G0460_300_hennawresi=You know those titles you get for trying really, really hard...? Those things...\nWell, I can't say it out loud, but you know... *those* things.
M6090_S0091_G0470_300_hennawresi=Turns out, unlocking them is a real pain, and there are a lot of androids who are struggling with it.
M6090_S0091_G0480_300_hennawresi=So with the help of some volunteers from all over, I've started a business to unlock "those things" for others.
M6090_S0091_G0490_300_hennawresi=It's a secret, but if you'd like, feel free to take a look...
M6090_S0091_G0500_300_hennamresi=Ah, magnificent... This head part is... magnificent!
M6090_S0091_G0510_300_hennamresi=When I equip this, I can see... I can see the world!
M6090_S0091_G0520_300_hennamresi=Listen to me! Ask a question of I, who has become all-knowing and all-powerful!
M6090_S0091_G0530_300_hennamresi=You can ask me a question anytime, got it?
M6090_S0091_G0531_300_hennamresi=Ooh, you're a Scanner Model from the YoRHa squad, aren't you...
M6090_S0091_G0532_300_hennamresi=There is nothing I do not know...
M6090_S0091_G0533_300_hennamresi=Well, maybe that's an exaggeration. But you can ask me about hacking and all sorts of other stuff, you know?
M6090_S0091_G0534_300_hennamresi=Ask me another question sometime, okay? It's a promise!
M6090_S0091_G0535_300_hennamresi=Please, ask me a question... For example, about hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0540_300_hennamresi=A question... Ask me a question!
M6090_S0091_G0550_300_hennamresi=Come ask a question again, okay? Being alone is lonely after all!
M6090_S0091_G0560_300_sele=Reading mail is inconvenient...
M6090_S0091_G0570_300_sele=The 3D map is hard to read...
M6090_S0091_G0580_300_sele=How does currency work in this world?
M6090_S0091_G0590_300_sele=What is a Black Box?
M6090_S0091_G0595_300_sele=Tell me about hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0600_300_sele=I have no questions.
M6090_S0091_G0610_300_hennamresi=Ah, it's true that you can only read mail at Access Points.
M6090_S0091_G0620_300_hennamresi=Apparently, the reason it isn't sent directly to YoRHa units\nis to prevent important classified information from being stolen.
M6090_S0091_G0630_300_hennamresi=Though, it seems there are plenty of androids who actually like the retro feel of mail and use it on purpose.
M6090_S0091_G0640_300_hennamresi=Ah, that. Apparently it turns information from satellites into map data, but...
M6090_S0091_G0650_300_hennamresi=The resolution of the satellite cameras is too low,\nso you can't see fine details or anything underground.
M6090_S0091_G0660_300_hennamresi=We get complaints from other androids, too, but it seems there's nothing that can be done about it.
M6090_S0091_G0670_300_hennamresi=But, sometimes it's more fun to walk around a bit on your own two feet and discover things... or maybe not.
M6090_S0091_G0680_300_hennamresi=Well, you'll just have to give up on it.
M6090_S0091_G0690_300_hennamresi=Basically, we disassemble the wreckage of destroyed enemies and use the parts reconstructed from them.
M6090_S0091_G0700_300_hennamresi=It's more convenient than going out of our way to dig up iron, right?
M6090_S0091_G0710_300_hennamresi=An item's value is decided by the weight of the wreckage and the rarity of the parts obtained from it. The unit for that value is called "G."
M6090_S0091_G0720_300_hennamresi=Huh? How do you pronounce "G"?
M6090_S0091_G0730_300_hennamresi=...I can't say. That's top secret.
M6090_S0091_G0740_300_hennamresi="What is it," you ask... It's a component of yours, so I'm not that familiar with it.
M6090_S0091_G0750_300_hennamresi=A Black Box is the fusion reactor equipped in YoRHa units.
M6090_S0091_G0760_300_hennamresi=However, its structure hasn't been disclosed to us in the Resistance.\nThere are rumors that some kind of suspicious material is used, though...
M6090_S0091_G0770_300_hennamresi=Say, that thing inside your body... if you don't mind, I'd love to disassemble and analyze it.
M6090_S0091_G0780_300_hennamresi=...No good, huh. Well, figures.
M6090_S0091_G0790_300_hennamresi=Since you're a Scanner Model, I think a <KC_HEAVY_ATK> prompt appears when you approach an enemy.
M6090_S0091_G0800_300_hennamresi=You can hack by holding down <KC_HEAVY_ATK>, but... there's a little trick to it.
M6090_S0091_G0810_300_hennamresi=If you sneak up quietly from behind so the enemy doesn't notice and then hack them...
M6090_S0091_G0820_300_hennamresi=You can actually hijack the enemy and control it remotely.
M6090_S0091_G0830_300_hennamresi=What's more, if you use that enemy to hack another enemy, you can perform a multi-stage hijacking.
M6090_S0091_G0840_300_hennamresi=You can even use it to infiltrate enemy territory disguised as an inconspicuous Machine Lifeform.
M6090_S0091_G0850_300_hennamresi=Give it a try sometime when you feel like it.
