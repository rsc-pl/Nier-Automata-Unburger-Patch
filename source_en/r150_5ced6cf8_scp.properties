M1020_S0010_G0120_001_resi=Recently, it's been dangerous around here...
M1020_S0010_G0130_001_resi=Just the other day, our comrades were attacked by enemies.
M1020_S0010_G0140_001_resi=I'm worried about what will happen from here on...
M1020_S0010_G0150_001_resi=It's easy to lose your footing in the desert, so be careful.
M1020_S0010_G0160_001_resi=Ah, you guys are YoRHa. I've heard the story.
M1020_S0010_G0170_001_resi=Our comrades are waiting in the rocky area ahead, so please head there.
M1020_S0010_G0180_001_resi=However, there are no places to resupply in the Desert Zone.
M1020_S0010_G0190_001_resi=If you need anything, it's better to exchange for it here before you go.
M1020_S0010_G0250_001_resi=...Try not to push yourself too hard.
M1020_S0010_G0260_001_resi=Ah, it's you guys.
M1020_S0010_G0270_001_resi=It helps that we can get materials from the desert now.
M1020_S0010_G0280_001_resi=It's a boring thing, but please take this as thanks.
M1020_S0010_G0290_001_resi=If you need anything, please stop by here.
M1020_S0010_G0300_001_resi=Will you exchange anything?
M1020_S0010_G0310_001_resi=It helps that you defeated the machines in the desert...
M1020_S0010_G0320_001_resi=Thank you.
M5150_S0030_G0080_001_ys=Ah, medicine? ...When I ingest it, my feelings become fluuuffy and easy...\nFufu... Fufufu...
M5150_S0030_G0090_001_ys=Medicine...? This is crazy... It's fun... I can't stop fighting.
M5150_S0030_G0100_001_pod042=Judged as side effects due to intake of medicine.
M5150_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0120_001_a2b=No, is it so painful that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5150_S0030_G0130_001_pod153=Judged as side effects due to intake of medicine.
M5150_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=No, is it so painful that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5150_S0030_G0160_001_pod042=Judged as side effects due to intake of medicine.
M5150_S0030_G0170_001_a2=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0180_001_a2=No, is it so painful that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5590_S0050_G0360_001_resistance=I wonder what kind of civilization existed... in this place.
M6030_S0010_G0000_300_ys=We are investigating this area.
M6030_S0010_G0010_300_ys=It's a tough mission for both of us but... let's do our best.
M6030_S0010_G0020_300_ys=This oil field seems usable as a resource.
M6030_S0010_G0030_300_ys=If we can suppress the activity of Machine Lifeforms in the Desert Zone,\nwe can transport it safely.
M6030_S0010_G0040_300_ys=Even if it's steady work, if it can save even one more comrade...
M6030_S0010_G0050_300_ys=You! What are you doing in a place like this.\nWhat about your mission.
M6030_S0010_G0060_300_ys=Me? ...I got lost!\nAhaha! Sorry to startle you.
M6030_S0010_G0070_300_ys=Only in this area, fresh water wells up and plants are growing.
M6030_S0010_G0080_300_ys=Even for androids, it's a difficult region to operate in,\nbut nature is amazing, isn't it.
M6030_S0010_G0090_300_ys=I'm going to investigate here a little longer.\nKeep it a secret from the Commander, okay?
M6030_S0010_G0100_300_robowoman=Oh my! Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0110_300_robowoman=How do you do?
M6030_S0010_G0120_300_n02=What did you come to do!
M6030_S0010_G0130_300_n02=Outsider!
M6030_S0010_G0140_300_n02=Weird guy.
M6030_S0010_G0150_300_n02=Did you come from outside.
M6030_S0010_G0160_300_sp=It's you guys.\nIt helps that we can get materials from the desert now.
M6030_S0010_G0170_300_sp=Will you exchange anything?
M6030_S0010_G0180_300_sp=Stop by again.
M6030_S0010_G0190_300_ys=We undertook the mission to send resources from this area to the Bunker.
M6030_S0010_G0200_300_ys=The environment here is harsh for androids to operate in but...
M6030_S0010_G0210_300_ys=...No, sorry. Let's concentrate on the mission.
M6030_S0010_G0220_300_ys=I heard you defeated the Machine Lifeforms!
M6030_S0010_G0230_300_ys=That's amazing! I respect you...
M6030_S0010_G0240_300_ys=Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0250_300_ys=I asked the Commander for the investigation mission here.\nI was happy because it's quiet and safe here.
M6030_S0010_G0260_300_ys=I wish other areas would become like this too.
M6030_S0010_G0261_300_js=Thanks for going along with the research.
M6030_S0010_G0262_300_js=I'm grateful to you.
M6030_S0010_G0263_300_js=If you have business, I'll lend a hand.
M6030_S0010_G0270_300_sp=Thanks to you guys, decent merchandise has been gathered.
M6030_S0010_G0280_300_sp=Will you exchange anything?
M6030_S0010_G0290_300_sp=Stop by again.
M6030_S0010_G0300_300_ys=Progress status is worse than estimated.
M6030_S0010_G0310_300_ys=I'm being pressed by Command too, I have to do something...
M6030_S0010_G0320_300_ys=What should I do...
M6030_S0010_G0330_300_ys=Good work!\nI check your activity records without fail!
M6030_S0010_G0340_300_ys=I'll do my best on my mission too!
M6030_S0010_G0350_300_ys=Hello!
M6030_S0010_G0360_300_ys=The other day, a flock of birds came here to rest their wings.\nI wonder if they know a path through the storm.
M6030_S0010_G0370_300_ys=Being here, I feel like time flows slowly.
M6030_S0010_G0380_300_ys=If you have the leeway, why not do some fishing or something?
M6030_S0010_G0381_300_js=I'm grateful to you.
M6030_S0010_G0382_300_js=Recently, there's something bothering me a bit...
M6030_S0010_G0383_300_js=Maybe I'll investigate a little.
M6030_S0010_G0390_300_sp=You were safe.\nLuckily damage was light in this area, but I don't know what will happen from now on.
M6030_S0010_G0400_300_sp=Will you exchange anything?
M6030_S0010_G0410_300_sp=See... ya.
M6030_S0010_G0420_300_ys=Medicine...? This is crazy... It's fun... I can't stop fighting.
M6030_S0010_G0430_300_ys=Mission? ...I don't care anymore. ...Leave me alone.
M6030_S0010_G0440_300_ys=Haa... Haa...
M6030_S0010_G0450_300_ys=Ah, medicine? ...I have no intention of recommending it at all, but if you insist...
M6030_S0010_G0460_300_ys=This medicine... did you want it?
M6030_S0010_G0470_300_ys=Thank you... With this... Fufufufu...
M6030_S0010_G0480_300_ys=...
M6031_S0011_G0411_300_js=The Bunker fell, huh...
M6032_S0012_G0412_300_js=White... Dammit!!
M6033_S0013_G0413_300_js=...Sorry, I had an acquaintance in the Bunker.
M6033_S0013_G0414_300_js=You are... A2...
M6033_S0013_G0415_300_js=...No, it's nothing. Be careful.
M6033_S0013_G0416_300_js=I'm not really in the mood to talk right now...
