M1010_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=9S...
M1010_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=The hangar is this way. Let's go.
M1010_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=By the Commander's orders,\nI've been assigned to handle 2B-san's maintenance.
M1010_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=I'll be checking you periodically from now on.
M1010_S0030_G0020_300_a9s=2B-san, do you have enough portable supplies?\nIf you're short, please resupply from the terminal in your room.
M1010_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=...Right.
M1010_S0030_G0030_300_a9s=Come to think of it... did I have enough portable supplies?
M1010_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=No need to worry though, right? Us 9S models are famous for being excellent.
M1010_S0030_G0040_300_a2b=Why don't you go resupply over there?
M1010_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=...Wait, that's not something I should be saying myself.
M1010_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M1010_S0030_G0060_300_a9s=This is my room.\nPlease come visit whenever you like.
M1010_S0030_G0061_001_a2b=...9S.
M1010_S0030_G0062_001_a9s=Eh? What is it?
M1010_S0030_G0063_001_a2b=Honorifics are unnecessary.
M1010_S0030_G0064_001_a9s=Eh?
M1010_S0030_G0065_001_a2b=...You don't need to add "-san" to my name.
M1010_S0030_G0066_001_a9s=Y-Yes... Understood.
M1010_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=...Ah, right.
M1010_S0030_G0070_300_a9s=Well, there's nothing here though.
M1010_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=The Commander was calling, so let's go together.
M1010_S0030_G0080_300_a2b=Did you leave something behind?
M1010_S0030_G0085_001_a9s=2B-sa... no, 2B.
M1010_S0030_G0090_001_cmd=Ah, 2B.
M1010_S0030_G0100_001_cmd=Is the maintenance finished?
M1010_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=Yes.
M1010_S0030_G0120_001_cmd=Annihilating the enemy via Black Box runaway reaction...
M1010_S0030_G0130_001_cmd=Don't be too reckless.
M1010_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=...Yes.
M1010_S0030_G0150_001_cmd=Sorry to do this right after maintenance, but there is a mission.
M1010_S0030_G0160_001_cmd=Join up with the Resistance members on the surface and gather intelligence.
M1010_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=Huh? Wasn't another YoRHa member assigned as the liaison with the Resistance...?
M1010_S0030_G0180_001_cmd=We haven't been able to make contact with the previous person in charge.
M1010_S0030_G0190_001_cmd=I want you to conduct a field survey that also serves to investigate the cause.
M1010_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Roger that.
M1010_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=The surface... that means we'll be moving by Flight Unit.
M1010_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Let's go to the hangar.
M1010_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=The Flight Units have high operating costs, so they don't let us use them very often...
M1010_S0030_G0240_001_a9s=I wish they'd produce cheaper units.
M5920_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=You cannot save data unless you are close to an Access Point.
M5920_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Please check the close-range map and save frequently.
