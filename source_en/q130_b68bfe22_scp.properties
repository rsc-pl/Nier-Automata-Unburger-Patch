M5130_S0010_G0000_001_resiwoman=Ah... ugh...
M5130_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Um, are you alright? You're with the Resistance, aren't you?
M5130_S0010_G0020_001_resiwoman=Ugh... there was an explosion in the ruins a little while ago, wasn't there?
M5130_S0010_G0030_001_resiwoman=I've been feeling a bit off from the shockwave ever since.
M5130_S0010_G0040_001_resiwoman=...Wait, you... the lady over there is YoRHa... have we met before?
M5130_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=No... Many YoRHa models look alike.
M5130_S0010_G0060_001_resiwoman=You're from the YoRHa squadron?
M5130_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Y-Yes, we are.
M5130_S0010_G0080_001_resiwoman=I hear you're incredibly high-performance...
M5130_S0010_G0090_001_resiwoman=If you don't mind, could you help me?
M5130_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Huh? ...Oh, yes. If there's anything we can do.
M5130_S0010_G0110_001_resiwoman=The truth is, a friend I was on a mission with... died.
M5130_S0010_G0120_001_resiwoman=I want to retrieve her last memories.
M5130_S0010_G0130_001_resiwoman=This broken Pod should have recorded a life log. Could you get it out for me?
M5130_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5130_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5130_S0010_G0160_001_resiwoman=Thank you!
M5130_S0010_G0170_001_resiwoman=Could you extract my friend's life log from the Pod?
M5130_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=Understood. I just need to extract the photos from that Pod, right?
M5130_S0010_G0190_001_telo=Extracted images from the life log.
M5130_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=What was just displayed is the final log left in the Pod.
M5130_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=It looks like a conflict between Resistance members...
M5130_S0030_G0020_001_resiwoman=Don't tell me... she was killed by the Resistance? By a comrade!?
M5130_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=Wait! It hasn't been fully restored yet.
M5130_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Unless I dive into a much deeper layer, I can't completely—
M5130_S0030_G0050_001_resiwoman=No, that's enough... it's enough...
M5130_S0030_G0060_001_resiwoman=This Resistance member in the red hood is her killer...
M5130_S0030_G0070_001_resiwoman=To kill a comrade... Unforgivable!
M5130_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=Wait!
M5130_S0030_G0090_001_resiwoman=What?
M5130_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Where are you going?
M5130_S0030_G0110_001_resiwoman=I'm going to find the culprit... and kill them.
M5130_S0030_G0120_001_a9s=Even if you say "kill," there's way too little information!
M5130_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Besides, there's a chance the culprit saw you, so it's dangerous.
M5130_S0030_G0140_001_resiwoman=Then, what should I do...?
M5130_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=I'll go investigate at the Resistance Camp.
M5130_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=A red hood isn't something you see very often, after all.
M5130_S0030_G0170_001_resiwoman=...Understood. I'm counting on you.
M5130_S0030_G0180_001_resiwoman=And I'll make the reward generous.
M5130_S0030_G0190_001_a2b=You're soft-hearted.
M5130_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Huh?
M5130_S0030_G0210_001_a2b=You're being a little too helpful, just because she's pretty.
M5130_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=No no no! That's not it at all!
M5130_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=I-I mean, it's not like she's unattractive...
M5130_S0030_G0240_001_a2b=It doesn't matter either way.
M5130_S0120_G0000_001_a9s=Come to think of it, she did say they were wearing a red hood...
M5130_S0120_G0010_001_a9s=That hood is a beautiful color.
M5130_S0120_G0020_001_resiwoman2=Huh? Oh, thank you. I got it from a friend.
M5130_S0120_G0030_001_resiwoman2=Today's the first time I've worn it. Do you think it suits me?
M5130_S0120_G0040_001_a9s=Yes, it suits you very well. It makes me want one, too.
M5130_S0120_G0050_001_a9s=I'd love to ask your friend where she got it...?
M5130_S0120_G0060_001_resiwoman2=Unfortunately, she's not here.
M5130_S0120_G0070_001_a9s=Is that so? Then where is she now?
M5130_S0120_G0080_001_resiwoman2=You're going to go ask her? You must have really taken a liking to that hood.
M5130_S0120_G0090_001_resiwoman2=She's at the desert encampment right now.
M5130_S0120_G0100_001_resiwoman2=She's the only woman there, so I think you'll spot her immediately.
M5130_S0120_G0110_001_a9s=Thank you very much!
M5130_S0120_G0120_001_resiwoman2=I hope you can get the hood.
M5130_S0130_G0000_001_a9s=So the red-hooded outfit was a present...
M5130_S0130_G0010_001_a2b=A present is a meaningless act.
M5130_S0130_G0020_001_a9s=W-What's wrong!? All of a sudden.
M5130_S0130_G0030_001_a2b=Sending things without asking the recipient is a nuisance.
M5130_S0130_G0040_001_a9s=Hmm... Maybe it's not the object itself, but the feeling behind it that's important?
M5130_S0130_G0050_001_a2b=Having feelings or emotions is prohibited.
M5130_S0130_G0060_001_a9s=Yes, yeees.
M5130_S0130_G0070_001_a2b=Say "yes" once.
M5130_S0130_G0080_001_a9s=Yees.
M5130_S0130_G0090_001_a9s=The female Resistance member who gave the red hood should be in the desert.
M5130_S0130_G0100_001_a2b=She could be the culprit, so we must be careful...
M5130_S0130_G0110_001_a9s=But there's only one female Resistance member at the desert encampment...
M5130_S0130_G0120_001_a9s=Huh...? She's not here.
M5130_S0130_G0130_001_a2b=Let's ask the person over there.
M5130_S0130_G0140_001_resiman=Huh...? You're looking for the female Resistance member?
M5130_S0130_G0150_001_resiman=Ah, you must mean Jackass.
M5130_S0130_G0180_001_resiman=She's the type of woman who tries to solve everything with explosions or other violent means...
M5130_S0130_G0190_001_resiman=If it's her, she should be in the desert caves right now on a geological survey.
M5130_S0130_G0200_001_resiman=I'll give you the location data, so you can go find her yourselves.
M5130_S0130_G0210_001_resiman=Oh, and one more thing...
M5130_S0130_G0220_001_resiman=You guys be careful not to get blown up, too.
M5130_S0130_G0240_001_a9s=Um... Jackass-san?
M5130_S0130_G0250_001_jackas=Hm? ...Need something?
M5130_S0130_G0260_001_a9s=Ah, we're just conducting a necessary field survey for the YoRHa squadron...
M5130_S0130_G0270_001_resiwoman2=Oh? Thanks for going out of your way.
M5130_S0130_G0280_001_a9s=Was it you who gave a red hood to your friend?
M5130_S0130_G0290_001_a9s=We want to obtain that red dye to color our squadron's flag...
M5130_S0130_G0300_001_jackas=Oh, that thing? It was forced on me out of nowhere.
M5130_S0130_G0310_001_a9s=Forced on you?
M5130_S0130_G0320_001_jackas=Yeah. I think it was right after the City Ruins exploded.
M5130_S0130_G0330_001_jackas=A Resistance woman with red hair came up and told me to buy it.
M5130_S0130_G0340_001_jackas=The hood itself was a color that seemed like it would suit my friend, so I figured, why not.
M5130_S0130_G0350_001_a9s=A Resistance woman... with red hair...
M5130_S0130_G0360_001_pod153=Features match the client.
M5130_S0130_G0370_001_jackas=Hm? Client?
M5130_S0130_G0380_001_a9s=No, it's nothing!
M5130_S0130_G0390_001_jackas=But, thinking back on it now, she was a strange one...
M5130_S0130_G0400_001_jackas=She was smiling the whole time.
M5130_S0130_G0410_001_a9s=Smiling...
M5130_S0130_G0420_001_a9s=Thank you very much. Excuse us.
M5130_S0140_G0000_001_pod153=Report: The red hair is consistent with the features of the female Resistance member who is the client.
M5130_S0140_G0010_001_a9s=Assuming it's her, why would she have the hood of the person who killed her friend...?
M5130_S0140_G0020_001_pod153=Deduction: The female Resistance member is either the culprit in question, or an accomplice.
M5130_S0140_G0030_001_a2b=...Let's just talk to her.
M5130_S0140_G0040_001_resiwoman=How was it? Did you find the one in the red hood who killed my friend!?
M5130_S0140_G0050_001_a9s=About that...
M5130_S0140_G0060_001_a9s=It seems there's a possibility that you were the one who sold that hood.
M5130_S0140_G0070_001_resiwoman=What...?
M5130_S0140_G0080_001_a9s=We were told that right after the explosion in the City Ruins, a red-haired Resistance woman came to sell a red hood.
M5130_S0140_G0090_001_resiwoman2=Red... hair...? I... sold that hood...?
M5130_S0140_G0100_001_a9s=There's also a possibility you had some kind of connection to the culprit...
M5130_S0140_G0110_001_resiwoman2=...I don't know. I don't know any of that...
M5130_S0140_G0120_001_a9s=But...
M5130_S0140_G0130_001_resiwoman2=...The records in this Pod... there are still parts we haven't seen, right?
M5130_S0140_G0140_001_resiwoman2=If so, then please. Check it right now!
M5130_S0140_G0150_001_a9s=This is difficult to say, but...
M5130_S0140_G0160_001_a9s=with your memory loss, there's a chance that you're the culprit...
M5130_S0140_G0170_001_resiwoman=...I don't care. I want to know the truth. So please!
M5130_S0140_G0180_001_a9s=...Understood. Then, I'll begin.
M5130_S0150_G0010_001_resiwoman=Ah... Aaah...
M5130_S0150_G0020_001_resiwoman=...I am... YoRHa Type E...
M5130_S0150_G0030_001_a9s=YoRHa?
M5130_S0150_G0040_001_resiwoman=A model made to kill other androids... to execute deserters and traitors...
M5130_S0150_G0050_001_resiwoman=I disguise myself, get close to the traitor, and kill them.
M5130_S0150_G0060_001_resiwoman=But one day, an order came down to kill my friend...
M5130_S0150_G0070_001_resiwoman=And so I... followed... the instructions...
M5130_S0150_G0080_001_a2b=...
M5130_S0150_G0090_001_resiwoman=But it was so painful. I wanted to run away from the fact that I had killed my best friend. That's why I... my memories...
M5130_S0150_G0100_001_a9s=You erased them... yourself.
M5130_S0150_G0110_001_resiwoman=Yes...
M5130_S0150_G0120_001_resiwoman=But this isn't the first time.
M5130_S0150_G0130_001_resiwoman=Again and again, I was ordered to become friends or lovers with someone, and then kill them...
M5130_S0150_G0140_001_resiwoman=Over, and over, and over again...
M5130_S0150_G0150_001_resiwoman=Heheh... Heheheh...
M5130_S0150_G0160_001_a9s=W-What's wrong!?
M5130_S0150_G0170_001_resiwoman=This is fine. This is fine, right?
M5130_S0150_G0180_001_resiwoman=I am YoRHa Type E... an Executioner model.
M5130_S0150_G0190_001_resiwoman=Killing my friends is... heehee... my mission...
M5130_S0150_G0200_001_resiwoman=Ah, heehee, thank you for investigating, heheh. I'll give you haha a reward.
M5130_S0150_G0210_001_a9s=No...
M5130_S0150_G0220_001_resiwoman=Heehee... If you want to kill a friend, let me know... It's my jorb job JOB job jorb job JOB job jorb WHAT job so... hehe.
M5130_S0150_G0230_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5130_S0150_G0240_001_a9s=YoRHa Type E... I didn't know such a model existed.
M5130_S0150_G0250_001_a9s=Did you know, 2B?
M5130_S0150_G0260_001_a2b=...
M5130_S0150_G0270_001_a2b=...There are some things you're better off not knowing.
M5130_S0150_G0280_001_a9s=That might... be true...
