M5540_S0030_G0270_001_a9s=Why would they steal supplies from the Resistance Camp...?
M5540_S0030_G0280_001_a9s=...That's right. Anemone-san might know something. 2B?

M5540_S0030_G0310_001_a9s=Actually, there's something I wanted to confirm...
M5540_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=I heard a rumor that YoRHa units recently stole resources from this camp. I wanted to ask about that.
M5540_S0030_G0330_001_ane=From YoRHa? That's the first I'm hearing about it.
M5540_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=...Huh?
M5540_S0030_G0350_001_ane=Our materials here are under distributed management, but I haven't received any such reports from any section.
M5540_S0030_G0360_001_a9s=...I see. Thank you.

M5540_S0030_G0390_001_a9s=Contacting Command. This is 9S, please respond.
M5540_S0030_G0400_001_op210=This is 21O. What is it?
M5540_S0030_G0410_001_a9s=Actually, it's about the YoRHa units that deserted...
M5540_S0030_G0420_001_op210=Yes. We have confirmed that information here as well.
M5540_S0030_G0430_001_a9s=However, the theft incident mentioned by the Commander never actually occurred at the Resistance Camp.
M5540_S0030_G0440_001_a9s=What is... what's going on...?
M5540_S0030_G0450_001_op210=...Access to the matter in question is restricted.
M5540_S0030_G0460_001_a9s=Huh...?
M5540_S0030_G0470_001_op210=It is by order of the Commander.
M5540_S0030_G0480_001_a9s=What? What does that mean?
M5540_S0030_G0490_001_op210=9S... be careful.
M5540_S0030_G0500_001_op210=That is all from my end.
M5540_S0030_G0510_001_a9s=Hey! Operator-san?!
M5540_S0030_G0520_001_a9s=Why...
M5540_S0030_G0530_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5540_S0030_G0540_001_a9s=But...
M5540_S0030_G0550_001_a2b=We... just fight. That's all.
