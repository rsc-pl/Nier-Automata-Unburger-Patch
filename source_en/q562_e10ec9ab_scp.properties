M5561_S0010_G0000_001_ppl=Oh, welcome.
M5562_S0010_G0000_001_dbl=Hey, you got a minute? I've got a favor to ask.
M5562_S0010_G0010_001_dbl=We need some "Sap" to repair the tents, but some pretty nasty enemies have popped up.
M5562_S0010_G0020_001_dbl=With our weapons...
M5562_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=Hey, Devola. Why are you two always made to do these dangerous chores?
M5562_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=If it requires fighting, you should just ask one of the other androids.
M5562_S0010_G0041_001_dbl=That's...
M5562_S0010_G0042_001_dbl=............
M5562_S0010_G0043_001_dbl=...Sorry.
M5562_S0010_G0050_001_a2=Hey. Why are you two always stuck with these dangerous chores?
M5562_S0010_G0060_001_a2=Your models aren't suited for this kind of work.
M5562_S0010_G0080_001_dbl=It's our job. We have to do it ourselves.
M5562_S0010_G0090_001_ppl=Devola...
M5562_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Help Devola and Popola.
M5562_S0010_G0110_001_sele=Do nothing.
M5562_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Fine. I'll take on the chore you were given.
M5562_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=A YoRHa model like me is better suited for combat, after all.
M5562_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=I just need to gather "Sap," right?
M5562_S0010_G0150_001_a2=Ugh, fine. I'll take care of this chore for you.
M5562_S0010_G0160_001_a2=An Attacker model like me is better suited for it anyway.
M5562_S0010_G0170_001_a2=I just need to get some "Sap," right?
M5562_S0010_G0180_001_dbl=You don't have to, that's a job we should be doing...
M5562_S0010_G0190_001_ppl=Devola, let's accept their help.
M5562_S0010_G0200_001_dbl=Popola...
M5562_S0010_G0210_001_ppl=I'm sorry about this. You're a great help.
M5562_S0010_G0220_001_dbl=Sorry to ask you to gather the "Sap"...
M5562_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Ah... I forgot to ask Devola where to find the "Sap."
M5562_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Pod. Search for regions where "Sap" can be collected.
M5562_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Search already complete. Area containing the material "Sap" has been marked on the map.
M5562_S0020_G0030_001_a2=Ah... I forgot to ask the red-heads where to find the "Sap."
M5562_S0020_G0040_001_a2=The area where I can get "Sap" is...
M5562_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Search already complete. Area containing the material "Sap" has been marked on the map.
M5562_S0020_G0060_001_a2=...You're a thoughtful little box.
M5562_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=Hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5562_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=So these are the enemies Devola and Popola mentioned...
M5562_S0020_G0081_001_a9s=But what's with that shape?
M5562_S0020_G0090_001_pod042=Hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5562_S0020_G0100_001_a2=Let's get this over with.
M5562_S0020_G0101_001_a2=What... is that?
M5562_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=Now I just need to gather the "Sap."
M5562_S0020_G0120_001_a2=Took care of the pests. Now to gather the "Sap."
M5562_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=This should be enough "Sap."
M5562_S0020_G0140_001_a2=That's enough "Sap." Guess I'll head back to them.
M5562_S0030_G0000_001_ppl=Oh, you brought the "Sap" we asked for.
M5562_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=It must have been difficult. Thank you.
M5562_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Is Devola... asleep?
M5562_S0030_G0030_001_a2=Is Devola... asleep?
M5562_S0030_G0040_001_ppl=Yes, it seems she got tired after drinking.
M5562_S0030_G0050_001_ppl=She'd been holding back lately, but when things get tough, she can't help it...
M5562_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Tough...?
M5562_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Tough...?
M5562_S0030_G0080_001_ppl=It's because our models are defective.
M5562_S0030_G0090_001_ppl=A long time ago, models of our type caused a major incident...
M5562_S0030_G0100_001_dbl=HEY! Popola! Bring me some booze!
M5562_S0030_G0110_001_dbl=Mumble mumble...
M5562_S0030_G0120_001_ppl=...Heh, honestly, Devola.
M5562_S0030_G0130_001_ppl=Oh, right. The alcohol Devola was drinking, I made it with the "Desert Roses" you gave us before.
M5562_S0030_G0140_001_ppl=Please, try some if you'd like.
M5562_S0030_G0150_001_dbl=Popola isn't allowed to drink... mumble... no way, meow!
M5562_S0030_G0160_001_dbl=I'll drink Popola's share for her... meow!
M5562_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=...Meow?
M5562_S0030_G0180_001_a2=...Meow?
M5562_S0030_G0190_001_ppl=Her sleep-talking is awful, isn't it? Heh.
M5562_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=...You're not having any?
M5562_S0030_G0210_001_a2=...You're not drinking?
M5562_S0030_G0220_001_ppl=Some other time.
M5562_S0030_G0230_001_ppl=Things get... complicated when I drink. I'll tell you about it someday.
M5562_S0030_G0240_001_ppl=Thank you so much for today. Please, get some rest yourself.
M5562_S0030_G0261_001_dbl=Can't drink anymore... mumble mumble...
M5562_S0030_G0262_001_dbl=Ugh... I feel sick, meow...
M5562_S0030_G0263_001_dbl=We... didn't do anything wrong...
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, see anything you like?
