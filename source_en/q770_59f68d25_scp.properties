M5770_S0010_G0000_001_kj=Ah... You guys are the YoRHa troops. I heard.
M5770_S0010_G0010_001_kj=I handle weapons here.
M5770_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What kind of weapons do you sell?
M5770_S0010_G0030_001_kj=Basically I re-service weapons that are heritage of the past.
M5770_S0010_G0040_001_kj=But, right now my tools are broken.
M5770_S0010_G0050_001_kj=If only the servicing device in this toolbox was fixed, I could resume weapon servicing and sales...
M5770_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=This is... pretty broken, isn't it.
M5770_S0010_G0070_001_kj=Right? As you can see, I'm not good at delicate work like device repair.
M5770_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Assist.
M5770_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Leave it alone.
M5770_S0010_G0100_001_kj=Phew... If the servicing device isn't fixed, business is done for.
M5770_S0010_G0110_001_kj=Hey hey... Really? That saves me.
M5770_S0010_G0119_001_a9s=This servicing device, the inside is shorted out from overload.
M5770_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=However, if we have about 4 "Complex Machines," I think I can fix it somehow.
M5770_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Is there a place we can obtain them around here?
M5770_S0010_G0140_001_kj=Ah... In that case, I often see them near the center of the City Ruins, but aggressive machines wander around that area... It's too dangerous to get close.
M5770_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=What the weapon shopkeeper said was around here, but...
M5770_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Machine Lifeforms confirmed. Moreover, there is a hostile reaction.
M5770_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Elimination of Hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5770_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Phew. We managed to defeat them.
M5770_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Let's search a little to see if the "Complex Machines" the weapon shopkeeper mentioned are here.
M5770_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=I wonder if this is all of them. Let's have the weapon shopkeeper look at them.
M5770_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=...Alright, with this, the servicing device repair is complete.
M5770_S0030_G0010_001_kj=Ooh, thank you! With this I can finally do business.
M5770_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=I see. I'm looking forward to it.
M5770_S0030_G0030_001_kj=Leave it to me! I make weapons to protect my comrades.
M5770_S0030_G0040_001_kj=But, say... sometimes, I think.
M5770_S0030_G0050_001_kj=That possibly, by making weapons, I might be making my comrades die faster...
M5770_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M5770_S0030_G0070_001_kj=Ah~ my bad. Forget that last part! Yeah?
M5770_S0030_G0080_001_kj=Come again! Next time I'll have new weapons prepared.
M5770_S0030_G0090_001_kj=Ah, it's you guys. Thanks to you I was saved.
M5770_S0030_G0091_200_robocreator=Come to think of it, I forgot to hand over a thank you...
M5770_S0030_G0100_001_kj=As thanks for fixing the machine, I'll give you strengthening materials.
M5770_S0030_G0101_300_robocreator=Will you try strengthening?
M5770_S0030_G0102_300_sele=Strengthen.
M5770_S0030_G0103_300_sele=Pass on it.
M5770_S0030_G0104_300_robocreator=If it's about weapons, consult me anytime.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Come to think of it, to repair and adjust weapons, you need a weapon to serve as the prototype base, right? How do you get them in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=Come to think of it, how do you get the prototype materials for making weapons in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=Come to think of it, how do you get the prototype materials for making weapons in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Ah, the owner of this shop sends them.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=A woman named "Accord" is the manager here. I'm just watching the shop and helping with maintenance.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=Even though I say manager, she only wanders back once every few years. Usually she just sends weapons via delivery drone.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=I don't know where she gets them, but many of the weapons are in good condition.
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=If you happen to meet her while you're out, give her my regards.
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=Purchased weapons can also be strengthened here.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=Money and strengthening materials are required, but they will become strong enough to be worth it. Also, depending on the weapon, some gain special abilities.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=If you feel like it, give it a try.
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Alright, with this, I've forged this weapon to Lv.3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=This is as far as we can do here but... apparently there is a master craftsman in this world who forges up to Lv.4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If such a guy exists, I'd like him to become my master.
