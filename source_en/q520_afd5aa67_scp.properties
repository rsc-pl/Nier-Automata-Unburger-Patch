M5520_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah... right. There is a matter I would like you to lend a hand with if possible.
M5520_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=I want you to collect information on the Old World scattered in various places.
M5520_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=The Old World? Why?
M5520_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=I thought I wanted to effectively utilize the heritage of the Old World to make this village easier to live in.
M5520_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=Of course, if there is useful information, I will pass it to you as well. Won't you please lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Lend strength.
M5520_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Do not lend.
M5520_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=Thank you. If you find information, please show it to me.
M5520_S0010_G0075_300_pascal=Please tell me if you find information on the Old World.
M5520_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=Goodness! Knowledge of the Old World should be important knowledge for you too... won't you lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=Won't you think of this old Machine Lifeform with pity... and lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=Please, somehow...
M5520_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=If there is information on the Old World, the lives of the children in this village will surely become easier... please reconsider.
M5520_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=The Old World information Pascal wants... is this it?
M5520_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Oh! Thank you... Humanity's information is full of interesting things.
M5520_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=This is a small thing, but as thanks...
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such valuable information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is your thanks. Please accept it.
M5520_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=It's information on the Old World... but, the content of this...
M5520_S0020_G0060_001_pod153=Information related to the creation of weapons using nuclear fission.
M5520_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=...I wonder if it's okay to give this to Pascal.
M5520_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Or maybe to the Commander...
M5520_S0020_G0090_001_pod153=9S is to make the decision.
M5520_S0020_G0100_001_pascal=This is...
M5520_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=Thank you. It is valuable information.
M5520_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=Yeah...
M5520_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=Technology like nuclear fission is a lost technology for us.
M5520_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=Because it is difficult to control and has a large impact on the environment, the Creator who birthed us sealed the information.
M5520_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=Such dangerous information... I cannot accept it...
M5520_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=...I see.
M5520_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=But, thank you for taking the trouble to bring it.
M5520_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=Here is a gift of thanks.
M5520_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=9S-san...
M5520_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=If I do not make nuclear weapons, and this village ends up destroyed, will everyone in the village resent me...?
M5520_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=...That isn't for me to decide.
M5520_S0020_G0220_001_pascal=Yes...
M5520_S0020_G0230_001_cmd=What is it? 9S.
M5520_S0020_G0240_001_a9s=Actually... I discovered something related to nuclear fission in the Old World information.
M5520_S0020_G0250_001_a9s=I wondered what to do with this information...
M5520_S0020_G0260_001_cmd=Nuclear weapons...
M5520_S0020_G0270_001_cmd=As I think you know, the use of nuclear weapons is restricted for us by directives from the Council of Humanity.
M5520_S0020_G0280_001_cmd=However, the enemy Machine Lifeforms also do not use nuclear weapons, though we don't know the reason.
M5520_S0020_G0290_001_cmd=We don't know the reason... but in any case, it's better to secure this information.
M5520_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=Understood.
M5520_S0020_G0310_001_cmd=Good work. It's not exactly a reward for providing information, but I'll deploy some maintenance materials to your room, so use them.
M5520_S0020_G0320_001_a9s=Thank you very much.
