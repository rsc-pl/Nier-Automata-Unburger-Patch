M5210_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Ah... you're androids...
M5210_S0010_G0010_001_n02=That means you've come to kill me...
M5210_S0010_G0020_001_n02=I've lived long enough, but if you're going to kill me, please don't make it too painful.
M5210_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Destroy.
M5210_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Do not destroy.
M5210_S0010_G0050_001_n02=Get it over with...
M5210_S0010_G0060_001_n02=...Why aren't you killing me?
M5210_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=...Because you have no will to fight.
M5210_S0010_G0080_001_a2b=You're like the Machine Lifeforms at Pascal's village.
M5210_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=If you don't cause us any harm, there's no reason to destroy you.
M5210_S0010_G0100_001_n02=You've met Pascal? I see...
M5210_S0010_G0110_001_n02=But, be careful, okay?
M5210_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=Of what?
M5210_S0010_G0130_001_n02=Among the Machine Lifeforms, there are some who go on uncontrollable rampages.
M5210_S0010_G0140_001_n02=They attack without caring about friend or foe.
M5210_S0010_G0150_001_n02=In the valley ahead, ones like that are prowling about.
M5210_S0010_G0160_001_n02=You shouldn't get close unless it's absolutely necessary...
M5210_S0010_G0170_001_a2b=Machine Lifeforms that attack indiscriminately...
M5210_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Recommendation: Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms.
M5210_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=The corpses of Machine Lifeforms... is this a graveyard?
M5210_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Be careful! They're still alive.
M5210_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Right!
M5210_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=There are still more!
M5210_S0020_G0040_001_n02=Kill... Kill...
M5210_S0020_G0050_001_n02=It hurts... Kill me...
M5210_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=It's saying... something.
M5210_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=2B! Don't let your guard down!
M5210_S0020_G0080_001_n02=Kill me...
M5210_S0020_G0090_001_n02=Kill... Kill... me.
M5210_S0020_G0100_001_n02=Please kill me.
M5210_S0020_G0110_001_a2b=Just what is this thing...?
M5210_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=It was talking...
M5210_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=Should we ask the Machine Lifeform who told us about this place?
M5210_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=She might know something.
M5210_S0030_G0000_001_n02=Ah... it's you two.
M5210_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=About the Machine Lifeforms in the valley ahead...
M5210_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Ah, those ones are dangerous, so you shouldn't get close...
M5210_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=It's okay now. We defeated all of them.
M5210_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Eeh!?
M5210_S0030_G0050_001_n02=...Is that so. Then, I suppose they can go to that place called Heaven, too?
M5210_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=Heaven?
M5210_S0030_G0070_001_n02=Recently, many Machine Lifeforms have been jumping into that valley.
M5210_S0030_G0080_001_n02=Some of them even hurt themselves, trying to break their own bodies.
M5210_S0030_G0090_001_n02=The ones who died like that, and the ones who failed to die, are all gathered in that valley.
M5210_S0030_G0100_001_n02=I don't really understand why they do such things, though.
M5210_S0030_G0110_001_n02=I am praying here so that their souls can go to Heaven.
M5210_S0030_G0120_001_n02=...This is my thanks.
M5210_S0030_G0130_001_n02=Thank you, for killing them for me.
M5210_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Praying so their souls can go to Heaven... huh.
M5210_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=I wonder if such a thing really exists?
M5210_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=...I'm sure we'll find out when we're annihilated from this world.
M5210_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=Us, too.
M5210_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=...You're right.
