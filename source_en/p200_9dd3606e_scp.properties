M1090_S0230_G0000_001_a9s=Shit! Enemies here too!
M1090_S0230_G0010_001_pascal=9S-san!
M1090_S0230_G0020_001_pascal=It seems all Machine Lifeforms connected to the network have gone berserk...
M1090_S0230_G0030_001_pascal=We've sealed the village entrance and are fighting back, but,
M1090_S0230_G0040_001_pascal=With our weaponry...
M1090_S0230_G0050_001_a2b=First, we eliminate these ones.
M1090_S0230_G0060_001_pascal=Thank you very much... You saved us.
M1090_S0230_G0070_001_a2b=What on earth happened?
M1090_S0230_G0080_001_pascal=All Machine Lifeforms connected to the network went berserk all at once.
M1090_S0230_G0090_001_pascal=Presumably, the unit controlling the whole thing has gone berserk.
M1090_S0230_G0100_001_a9s=It's that... Machine Lifeform called "Eve."
M1090_S0230_G0110_001_a2b=If we destroy that controlling unit, will all activity stop?
M1090_S0230_G0120_001_pascal=Most likely...
M1090_S0230_G0130_001_a2b=Pod! Can you identify Eve's location?
M1090_S0230_G0140_001_pod042=Report: Location already identified. Mapping complete.
M1090_S0230_G0150_001_a2b=We will defeat Eve.
M1090_S0230_G0160_001_a9s=Pascal, you protect the village!
M1090_S0230_G0170_001_pascal=Please take care!
M1090_S0230_G1060_001_pascal=Thank you very much... You saved us.
M1090_S0230_G1080_001_pascal=All Machine Lifeforms connected to the network went berserk all at once.
M1090_S0230_G1090_001_pascal=Presumably, the unit controlling the whole thing has gone berserk.
M1090_S0230_G1120_001_pascal=Most likely...
