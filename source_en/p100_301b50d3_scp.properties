M0010_S0220_G1030_101_a9s=2B-san!
M0010_S0220_G1040_101_a2b=What is it?
M0010_S0220_G1050_101_a9s=I'm transferring over the map data I surveyed in advance.
M0010_S0220_G1060_101_a2b=Roger.
M0010_S0220_G1110_101_a9s=2B-san... I'm... glad.
M0010_S0220_G1120_101_a2b=About what?
M0010_S0220_G1130_101_a9s=We Scanner types mostly do our preliminary field surveys alone.
M0010_S0220_G1140_101_a9s=So, getting to work together with someone... it's fun.
M0010_S0220_G1150_101_a2b=...Emotions are prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G1160_101_a9s=Ah... My apologies!
M0010_S0220_G1170_101_a2b=Also...
M0010_S0220_G1180_101_a2b=You can drop the "-san".
M0010_S0220_G1190_101_a9s=...Huh?
M0010_S0220_G1200_101_a2b=Honorifics for my name are unnecessary.
M0010_S0220_G1210_101_a9s=...Got it. 2B!
M0010_S0220_G1220_101_a2b=These ruins are vast...
M0010_S0220_G1230_101_a9s=Apparently, this place used to be a human weapons factory a long time ago.
M0010_S0220_G1240_101_a9s=Though now, it's completely overrun with Machine Lifeforms...
M0010_S0220_G1250_101_a9s=It seems the enemy is reusing this factory to mass-produce more of them.
M0010_S0220_G1260_101_a2b=So they'll just keep spawning unless we wipe them all out...
M0010_S0220_G1266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G1267_101_a9s=It's just spewing nonsense using Old World data.
M0010_S0220_G1268_101_a9s=There's no meaning to anything the Machine Lifeforms do.
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=Oh, are those birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Maybe because of the environmental changes, but it seems there are\nmore animals and plants now than in the Old World.
M0010_S0700_G1031_101_a2b=That's...
M0010_S0700_G1040_101_a2b=I've swept the factory, but couldn't find any weapon resembling the target.
M0010_S0700_G1060_101_a9s=Maybe they moved it to another location.
M0010_S0700_G1061_101_a9s=There should be another facility beyond that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G1062_101_a9s=It's a little far, but shall we head over?
M0010_S0700_G1070_101_a9s=Still, for Command to miscalculate the enemy's predicted position... that's rare.
M0010_S0700_G1080_101_a2b=No.
M0010_S0700_G1090_101_a2b=I'm not so sure...
M0010_S0733_G0000_201_a9s=2B!? What's wrong!!
M0010_S0733_G0005_001_a2b=
M0010_S0733_G0010_201_pod153=Report: Subject has engaged the enemy Large-Scale Weapon.
M0010_S0733_G0020_201_a9s=We have to provide support... Let's hurry!
