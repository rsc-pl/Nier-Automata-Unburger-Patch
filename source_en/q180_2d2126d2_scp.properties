M5180_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Huh? Operator-san, what are you doing?
M5180_S0010_G0010_001_op210="What?" Data analysis.
M5180_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=Data analysis? Is that your current mission?
M5180_S0010_G0030_001_op210=No. It is merely a hobby.
M5180_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Just a hobby... Why would you do something like that...?
M5180_S0010_G0050_001_op210=Coordinate data, communication log data, photographed image data... There's a lot of data in the world.
M5180_S0010_G0060_001_op210=By analyzing that data, new information comes to light.
M5180_S0010_G0070_001_op210=My hobby is discovering that information.
M5180_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Data analysis... It sounds kind of boring.
M5180_S0010_G0090_001_op210=I judge it to be more useful than having useless small talk with you, at least.
M5180_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=That's mean!
M5180_S0010_G0110_001_op210=Ah, there is a good way to make this small talk not useless.
M5180_S0010_G0120_001_op210=There is an information terminal in the abandoned factory grounds that cannot be accessed from a satellite.
M5180_S0010_G0130_001_op210=Please access those terminals and transfer the information.
M5180_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Got it! I'll check it right away!
M5180_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Eeh? What a pain...
M5180_S0010_G0160_001_op210=A good answer. In that case, I will transmit the position coordinates you should investigate.
M5180_S0010_G0165_001_op210=The terminal is in a hard-to-find place inside the factory, so be careful.
M5180_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=Yees. Well, I'll contact you again once I've checked it out~
M5180_S0010_G0180_001_op210=In that case, I will transmit the position coordinates you should investigate.
M5180_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Eeh!? I didn't say I'd investigate!
M5180_S0010_G0200_001_op210=You didn't say you *wouldn't* investigate, either.
M5180_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=That's mean!
M5180_S0010_G0211_001_op210=The terminal is in a hard-to-find place inside the factory, so do your best to look for it.
M5180_S0010_G0220_001_op210=I've asked you to conduct an information survey at the abandoned factory grounds.
M5180_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=This factory has turned into a nest for Machine Lifeforms.
M5180_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=I wonder what kind of place it was before...
M5180_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Reference Result: A weapons production factory from the time when human civilization was still intact.
M5180_S0020_G0030_001_pod153=They conducted weapons production and experiments here.
M5180_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Hee... what kind of weapons did they make?
M5180_S0020_G0050_001_pod153=They primarily manufactured humanoid weapons. Representative model names were P-22 and P-33.
M5180_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=Humanoid weapons, huh. I wonder if they were like the Flight Units?
M5180_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=No photographic materials of the said weapons currently exist.
M5180_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Looks like I can access the data from over there...
M5180_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=I was able to get the data the Operator was talking about.
M5180_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Now, I just have to transmit it.
M5180_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Report: Radio signal strength in this location is insufficient.
M5180_S0030_G0040_001_pod153=Recommendation: Move to a location with a better communication environment.
M5180_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=Roger.
M5180_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Communication should be possible from here...
M5180_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Pod. Upload the data to the Operator.
M5180_S0030_G0080_001_pod153=Roger.
M5180_S0030_G0090_001_op210=From Operator 21O to 9S. Please respond.
M5180_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Yes. This is 9S.
M5180_S0030_G0110_001_op210=I have confirmed receipt of the data.
M5180_S0030_G0120_001_op210=I am currently analyzing it and... this is interesting.
M5180_S0030_G0130_001_op210=This data appears to be the diary of a human who worked at the factory in the past.
M5180_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=A diary?
M5180_S0030_G0150_001_op210=According to the diary, they labored at the factory for long hours every day,
M5180_S0030_G0160_001_op210=and it is recorded that, "It's like I'm working like a machine."
M5180_S0030_G0170_001_op210=To become like a machine in order to make machines at a factory... Humanity is strange.
M5180_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=I see...
M5180_S0030_G0190_001_op210=I will send a special reward by email later.
M5180_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=A reward? I'm getting a reward?
M5180_S0030_G0210_001_op210=I never once said I would not give you a reward.
M5180_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Well, that's true, but~
M5180_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=...Wait, the communication cut off.
M5920_S0020_G0180_001_pod153=Report: Mail reception notification from Access Point.
