M5720_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=...I don't know them.
M5720_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=They were my comrades, from the same squad. They went out to investigate and I haven't heard from them since. If... if by some chance...
M5720_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=...If they're dead, I'd at least like to give them a proper burial.
M5720_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=...You're not going to look for them?
M5720_S0010_G0050_001_resiman=I'd love to, but my motor functions got messed up in the last battle.
M5720_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=But... I'm still just so worried about them.
M5720_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Help with the search.
M5720_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Do not help with the search.
M5720_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=Sorry to trouble you. Just forget about it.
M5720_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=I want to go look for them, but I can't just abandon my duties here...
M5720_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=I'll go look for them.
M5720_S0010_G0120_001_resiman=...Are you sure?
M5720_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Yes. Please tell me the last place you were in contact.
M5720_S0010_G0140_001_resiman=Thank you. The location is around the Flooded City.
M5720_S0010_G0141_001_resiman=I'll give you my comrades' authentication codes. Also, a defining feature of ours is that we all use two weapons at once.
M5720_S0010_G0150_001_resiman=If they're dead, I'd like you to collect their belongings.
M5720_S0010_G0190_001_resiman=We lost contact with them in the Flooded City. If they're dead... please collect their belongings for me.
M5720_S0010_G0195_001_resiman=They were all carrying two weapons, so I think you'll recognize them as soon as you see them.

M5720_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=...He's dead.
M5720_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=The only thing left of him is this dog tag...

M5720_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=They were all dead... I'm sorry.

M5720_S0030_G0070_001_resiman=Ah... No. It's just an imitation.
M5720_S0030_G0080_001_resiman=Apparently, humans had a custom of mourning the dead. Not that it means much now...
M5720_S0030_G0090_001_resiman=They would entrust a flower with the wish that the souls of the dead might rest in peace.
M5720_S0030_G0100_001_resiman=Well, see you. Thanks for your help.
M5720_S0030_G0110_001_resiman=...I... was somewhere relieved that I was injured and didn't have to go to the battlefield.
M5720_S0030_G0120_001_resiman=Relieved... and running away...
