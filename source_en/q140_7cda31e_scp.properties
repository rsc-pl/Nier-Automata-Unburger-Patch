M5140_S0010_G0000_001_resiwoman=Ah! You are YoRHa's latest models...!
M5140_S0010_G0000_300_resiwoman=I know you're busy, but if you have time, please give me some advice. \nPlease.
M5140_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=W... Well, if you say latest models, that is true but... is something wrong?
M5140_S0010_G0010_300_resiwoman=Will you give me some advice?
M5140_S0010_G0020_001_resiwoman=If you're the latest models, you must be strong...
M5140_S0010_G0020_300_sele=Give advice
M5140_S0010_G0030_001_resiwoman=In that case... no, never mind...
M5140_S0010_G0030_300_sele=Leave her alone
M5140_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Listen to her problem.
M5140_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Leave her alone.
M5140_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=If there's something wrong, just tell us, we'll give you advice?
M5140_S0010_G0070_001_resiwoman=Y-yes! Actually, recently, one of my comrades has gone missing.
M5140_S0010_G0071_001_a9s=Missing... that doesn't sound peaceful.
M5140_S0010_G0072_001_a2b=Where was he last confirmed seen?
M5140_S0010_G0073_001_resiwoman=The material storage. He was working there...
M5140_S0010_G0074_001_a9s=Material storage, huh... Shall we go take a look?
M5140_S0010_G0075_001_resiwoman=Please! Without him, I... Please!
M5140_S0020_G0000_001_a2b=On the pillar... something is carved.
M5140_S0020_G0000_300_resiwoman=I hope there is some clue at the material storage in the back of the camp... \nThat person... where did he go...
M5140_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=This is a numerical sequence.
M5140_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Since there are three sequences, it might be coordinates of some sort.
M5140_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=A destination? Or, a hiding place for something...?
M5140_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=I'll point it on the map.
M5140_S0020_G0050_300_a2b=It won't open...
M5140_S0020_G0060_300_a9s=It won't open...
M5140_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=If we convert the numerical sequence written in the Resistance Camp to coordinates...
M5140_S0030_G0000_300_resiwoman=Are these... coordinates? \nIt looks like it's towards the desert... but what business would he have in a place like that?
M5140_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=It should be around here...
M5140_S0030_G0010_300_resiwoman=I'm sorry when I got you to cooperate \nPlease come back later
M5140_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=9S!
M5140_S0030_G0020_300_resiwoman=I have to focus on the mission right now...
M5140_S0030_G0030_001_n02=...KILL! KILL! KILL!
M5140_S0030_G0040_001_n02=AVENGE... KILL...
M5140_S0030_G0050_001_n02=HINDRANCE... THE ONES WHO DO... EVERYONE...
M5140_S0030_G0060_001_n02=ANDROID... UNFORGIVABLE...
M5140_S0030_G0070_001_n02=EVERYONE, EVERYONE, EVERYONEEVERYONEEVERYONE
M5140_S0030_G0080_001_n02=EVERYEVERYEVERYKILLKILLKILLKILLKILLKILL,
M5140_S0030_G0090_001_n02=K I L L!!!
M5140_S0040_G0000_001_a2b=Pod, analyze this Machine Lifeform.
M5140_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Eh? Why?
M5140_S0040_G0020_001_a2b=Because it was saying something a little concerning...
M5140_S0040_G0030_001_pod042=Analysis Complete: The subject Machine Lifeform had its comrades destroyed.
M5140_S0040_G0040_001_pod042=Using that grudge as a reason, it lured the Resistance male here,
M5140_S0040_G0050_001_pod042=and ultimately, it appears to have destroyed him.
M5140_S0040_G0060_001_a2b=A Machine Lifeform... took revenge?
M5140_S0040_G0070_001_a9s=It's a little hard to believe they possess such a complicated concept...
M5140_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=This corpse... is it the missing person we were asked to find at the Resistance Camp?
M5140_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Let's examine the memory.
M5140_S0040_G0100_001_a9s=This person came here for revenge too.
M5140_S0040_G0110_001_a2b=...And, the weaker one was killed.
M5140_S0040_G0120_001_a9s=...
M5140_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=This case...
M5140_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=My heart feels heavy reporting to the client woman.
M5140_S0050_G0020_001_a2b=Now that we know the truth, we must tell her.
M5140_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=Even if... it's that kind of truth?
M5140_S0050_G0040_001_a2b=...
M5140_S0050_G0050_001_resiwoman=Ah! Um, how was it? That person...
M5140_S0050_G0060_001_sele=Tell her he died.
M5140_S0050_G0070_001_sele=Tell her he wasn't found.
M5140_S0050_G0080_001_a9s=When we went there, he was already... dead.
M5140_S0050_G0090_001_resiwoman=Eh...
M5140_S0050_G0100_001_a9s=It seems he held a grudge against the Machine Lifeforms for defeating his comrades, and went for revenge.
M5140_S0050_G0110_001_resiwoman=No way... no way...!
M5140_S0050_G0120_001_a9s=But, he had the tables turned on him...
M5140_S0050_G0130_001_resiwoman=...Machine Lifeform... Kill... I'll kill them!
M5140_S0050_G0140_001_a9s=Calm down! We destroyed that Machine Lifeform.
M5140_S0050_G0150_001_resiwoman=...Eh?
M5140_S0050_G0160_001_a9s=So, it's okay not to seek revenge anymore.
M5140_S0050_G0170_001_resiwoman=Then... then, what should I do?
M5140_S0050_G0180_001_resiwoman=To have neither a partner I love... nor a partner I want to kill...
M5140_S0050_G0190_001_resiwoman=What... should I do...
M5140_S0050_G0200_001_a9s=That's...
M5140_S0050_G0210_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5140_S0050_G0220_001_a9s=We'll... come again.
M5140_S0050_G0230_001_resiwoman=Is that so...
M5140_S0050_G0240_001_resiwoman=I apologize for the trouble.
M5140_S0050_G0250_001_resiwoman=But...
M5140_S0050_G0260_001_resiwoman=...
M5140_S0050_G0270_001_resiwoman=It's a lie, right?
M5140_S0050_G0280_001_a9s=Eh!?
M5140_S0050_G0290_001_resiwoman=He said he would take revenge on the Machine Lifeforms.
M5140_S0050_G0300_001_resiwoman=So, surely...
M5140_S0050_G0310_001_a9s=Y-you can't know that for sure!
M5140_S0050_G0320_001_resiwoman=Fufu... You're kind.
M5140_S0050_G0330_001_resiwoman=Thank you.
M5140_S0050_G0340_001_a9s=Huh? That person isn't here...
M5140_S0050_G0350_001_resiman=Ah, the girl who was there? She left a while ago.
M5140_S0050_G0360_001_resiman=She was carrying weapons, and had a grave look on her face.
M5140_S0050_G0370_001_a9s=That means...
M5140_S0050_G0380_001_resiman=Come to think of it, there's something she asked me to give to you guys.
M5140_S0050_G0390_001_a2b=This much...
M5140_S0050_G0400_001_resiman=She said she didn't need it anymore.
M5140_S0050_G0410_001_resiman=I don't really understand what women think...
