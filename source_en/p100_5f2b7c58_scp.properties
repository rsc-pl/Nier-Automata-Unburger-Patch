M0010_S0700_G0031_101_a2b=That is...
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=Ah, birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Perhaps due to environmental changes, it seems there are\nmore animals and plants than there were in the Old World.
M0010_S0700_G0040_101_a2b=I explored the factory generally, but I couldn't discover any weapon resembling the target.
M0010_S0700_G0060_101_a9s=Maybe they moved it to another location.
M0010_S0700_G0061_101_a9s=There should be another facility beyond that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G0062_101_a9s=It's a little far, but shall we try moving there?
M0010_S0700_G0070_101_a9s=Still, for Command to mistake the predicted location of an enemy weapon... that's rare.
M0010_S0700_G0080_101_a2b=No.
M0010_S0700_G0090_101_a2b=I wonder about that...
