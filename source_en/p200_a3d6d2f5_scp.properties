M1050_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=...That is all for the report on the Alien Ship.
M1050_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=Is that so... The Aliens are already...
M1050_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=...This information, until a conclusion is reached at the Council of Humanity,
M1050_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=will be treated as top secret.
M1050_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=Make absolutely sure not to speak of it to others.
M1050_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Yes.
M1050_S0010_G0060_001_cmd=I order you two to collect information on a Machine Lifeform named "Pascal".
M1050_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Eh!? That suspicious-feeling Machine Lifeform?
M1050_S0010_G0080_001_cmd=It is a notification from the Council of Humanity on the moon.
M1050_S0010_G0090_001_cmd=Investigation of special individuals will become important data for future operations.
M1050_S0010_G0100_001_a2b=Understood.
M1050_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=The Commander is really rough with handling people too, isn't she~
M1050_S0010_G0111_001_a9s=Besides, the destination is the City Ruins again.
M1050_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=It's been a while, why don't we rest a bit? 2B.
M1050_S0010_G0113_001_a2b=If I feel like it.
M1050_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=But, work is tough, isn't it~
M1050_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=There is no like or dislike in operations.
M1050_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=9S, you are showing too much emotion.
M1050_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=We YoRHa troops are supposed to be prohibited from showing emotion.
M1050_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Even if you say that, there are individual differences so I feel it can't be helped...
M1050_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=That Adam and Eve... those special individuals also seemed like they had emotions.
M1050_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=...Enough, we're going to the transfer device location.
M1050_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Yees.
