M6120_S0000_G0000_001_resi=Wow~, this place really is the best facility!
M6120_S0000_G0010_001_resi=I hear you're popular lately, I'm expecting things!
M6120_S0000_G0020_001_resi=Thanks to you defeating the S Rank King, that guy is back to living in a cell for the time being. Thanks!
M6120_S0010_G0000_001_resi=Would you believe the guys at the top think all of this is illegal? How stupid is that!?
M6120_S0010_G0010_001_resi=I hear you're quite strong, I'll go watch a match next time.
M6120_S0010_G0020_001_resi=Wow~ your match was the best!
M6120_S0010_G0030_001_resi=There are idiots who sometimes badmouth this facility, but they are truly pitiful guys who don't understand the fun of this place. You think so too right?
M6120_S0020_G0000_001_resi=How is it, are you enjoying yourself too?
M6120_S0020_G0010_001_resi=You've started to understand how to enjoy this place too right?
M6120_S0020_G0020_001_resi=Do you find it strange why this facility isn't exposed?
M6120_S0020_G0030_001_resi=Even the guys in the upper echelons aren't idiots, they know of this facility's existence and tacitly approve it.
M6120_S0020_G0040_001_resi=They understand. That by being able to vent steam here, rebellion and defection are being suppressed.
M6120_S0020_G0050_001_resi=Besides, part of the money here flows to the top.\nWell, organizations are just like that.
M6120_S0020_G0060_001_resi=For your own sake, you'd better not stick your neck into unnecessary things too much either.
M6120_S0030_G0000_001_resi=Everywhere is a fierce battlefield lately.\nWithout this, I would have deserted long ago.
M6120_S0030_G0010_001_resi=Thanks to you smashing Machine Lifeforms to pieces, my stress is gone. Thanks!
M6120_S0030_G0020_001_resi=Since knowing this place, killing Machine Lifeforms on the battlefield is fun and enjoyable, it's truly the best.
M6120_S0040_G0000_001_resi=Thanks to this place I can keep doing tough jobs.
M6120_S0040_G0010_001_resi=Ah, thanks to this place I can do my best tomorrow too.
M6120_S0040_G0020_001_resi=Your way of breaking Machine Lifeforms, it was already the best!
M6120_S0050_G0000_001_resi=I have...... good stuff in stock, you know?
M6120_S0050_G0010_001_resi=It can't be helped, it's somewhat dangerous but I guess I'll try going to stock up around the Underground Cave.
M6120_S0050_G0020_001_resi=It's been a while since a guy cleared the highest rank. You can become a good hunter.
M6120_S0060_G0000_001_resi=I want to stock a new one for 10,000G but.
M6120_S0060_G0010_001_resi=The one I bought recently was no good, it broke immediately. Give me a sturdier one.
M6120_S0060_G0020_001_resi=Oh, I saw your match. With that skill, bring me a lively one!
M6120_S0070_G0000_001_resi=Sorry but beyond here is off limits.
M6120_S0070_G0020_001_resi=How is it, there aren't many shows more interesting than this right?
M6120_S0080_G0000_001_resi=Shit! Shit!\nBecause that guy lost, my fortune went poof!
M6120_S0080_G0010_001_resi=How's that, how's that! I won, I won! Look, it's a fortune! Ahahaha!
M6120_S0080_G0020_001_resi=Eh, you ask what happened to the other guy who was here?
M6120_S0080_G0030_001_resi=He continued losing and couldn't pay back the money, so he got taken somewhere. What an utter idiot.
M6120_S0080_G0040_001_resi=I can still do it. Alright, next time I'll aim for a bigger long shot......
M6120_S0090_G0000_001_resi=Bad bad bad......\nHow should I pay back such a fortune......
M6120_S0100_G0000_001_resi=Please refrain from going beyond here unless you are a Colosseum participant.
M6120_S0100_G0010_001_resi=If you are participating, please take care of procedures at the reception.
M6120_S0110_G0000_001_resi=Here, I'm torn whether I should go safe, or aim for a long shot......
M6120_S0110_G0010_001_resi=Oh I saw your match, next time I'll definitely let myself bet on you!
M6120_S0110_G0020_001_resi=To think you'd beat the Colosseum King, I should have bet on you.
M6120_S0110_G0030_001_resi=I'll definitely bet on you next time, so tell me when you participate.
M6120_S0120_G0000_001_resi=What are you doing!!\nIf you don't break them more flashily, it's boring!!
M6120_S0120_G0010_001_resi=Don't fall behind such a piece of junk, damn it!!
M6120_S0120_G0020_001_resi=Hey hey, don't stop your hands! Even after it breaks, tear it to shreds!!
M6120_S0130_G0000_001_resi=Alright!!\nThere, smash it!!
M6120_S0130_G0010_001_resi=Oooooh!!\nYour match was supremely exciting!!
M6120_S0130_G0020_001_resi=WOOOOOOH!!\nI was supremely moved that you actually defeated that King!!
M6120_S0140_G0000_001_resi=When I watch Machine Lifeforms burst apart, my chest feels, like, organized.
M6120_S0140_G0010_001_resi=I wonder what I should call this sensation.
M6120_S0140_G0020_001_resi=When I checked human literature, I guess the sensation felt when seeing Machine Lifeforms burst apart is close to "Refreshing" or "Pleasant" or "Clearing the air".
M6120_S0140_G0030_001_resi=We've been put through terrible things by Machine Lifeforms after all.\nThe sight of them being broken is truly refreshing.
M6120_S0140_G0040_001_resi=Ahahaha pleasant, the sight of them breaking is truly pleasant!
M6120_S0150_G0000_001_resi=What are you doing, you piece of junk!!
M6120_S0150_G0010_001_resi=I bet on you, go like you're gonna die!!
M6120_S0150_G0020_001_resi=I saw your match, if it's you, you might be able to break that damn cheeky S Rank King, I'm expecting things.
M6120_S0150_G0030_001_resi=It's the best! Thanks to you defeating the King, I can still keep the King as a slave.
M6120_S0160_G0000_001_resi=Wow, front row is the way to go after all!
M6120_S0160_G0010_001_resi=It's irresistible when bullets rarely fly over here!!
M6120_S0160_G0020_001_resi=Like, I get the shivers!!
M6120_S0160_G0030_001_resi=Recently bullets don't fly over much even in the front row......
M6120_S0160_G0040_001_resi=Give me more, send more bullets over here, give me the thrill, the THRILL!!
M6120_S0160_G0060_001_resi=It's amazing that you conquered S Rank.
M6120_S0160_G0070_001_resi=Ah, I want to bathe in more dangerous S Rank bullets.
M6120_S0170_G0000_001_resi=You, you're a new face.\nIf you bet here, you'd better be careful.
M6120_S0170_G0010_001_resi=There are many guys who went bankrupt here, but everyone gets taken somewhere and stops coming back.
M6120_S0170_G0020_001_resi=You're the android who is rumored, you...... are you enjoying this facility?
M6120_S0170_G0030_001_resi=This is a place that embodies survival of the fittest where only the strong can enjoy.
M6120_S0170_G0040_001_resi=However, it is doubtful whether androids are the strong ones of this world.
M6120_S0170_G0050_001_resi=You, what do you think about this facility?
M6120_S0170_G0060_001_resi=Androids who had many comrades killed have a just cause to kill Machine Lifeforms.
M6120_S0170_G0070_001_resi=But, most of the guys here are just enjoying killing using the just cause as a shield.
M6120_S0170_G0080_001_resi=Perhaps, as long as they can kill, the opponent doesn't even have to be a Machine Lifeform.
M6120_S0170_G0090_001_resi=However, thanks to this facility, there are many whose will to live has welled up.
M6120_S0170_G0100_001_resi=I wonder who can judge whether the guys here are normal or crazy......
M6120_S0180_G0000_001_resi=Shit, another loss!!
M6120_S0180_G0010_001_resi=Maybe I should try participating in the battle too......
M6120_S0180_G0020_001_resi=Owowowow......
M6120_S0180_G0030_001_resi=Shit, I shouldn't have participated in a battle!
M6120_S0190_G0000_001_resi=As expected, low rank matches are boring to watch......
M6120_S0190_G0010_001_resi=I want to see high rank matches, but they're expensive......
M6120_S0190_G0020_001_resi=Your match entertained me supremely.
M6120_S0190_G0030_001_resi=For the high ticket price, high rank matches are indeed a cut above.
M6120_S0190_G0040_001_resi=Getting used to things is scary.\nThose high rank matches that were so fun have now become boring.
M6120_S0190_G0050_001_resi=We androids are unexpectedly greedy things, aren't we.
M6120_S0200_G0000_001_resi=The S Rank King is quite a strong person, currently winning 90 consecutive times.
M6120_S0200_G0010_001_resi=Matches where he appears are popular so it's hard to get tickets.
M6120_S0200_G0020_001_resi=I watched you, pretty good skill.
M6120_S0200_G0030_001_resi=Since then, the King continued winning further and achieved 96 consecutive wins.
M6120_S0200_G0040_001_resi=Will he hit 100 wins first, or perhaps will you defeat him first......
M6120_S0200_G0050_001_resi=Ah you, it seems you defeated the King.
M6120_S0200_G0060_001_resi=I thought if it was him, he would win 100 times and escape from here but......
M6120_S0200_G0070_001_resi=In the end, neither Androids nor Machine Lifeforms can escape from their determined fate......
M6120_S0210_G0000_001_resi=Ah~ no good...... seems I have no luck today.
M6120_S0210_G0010_001_resi=Seems like consecutive wins continue, apparently I have luck.
M6120_S0210_G0020_001_resi=You can't go against the flow of luck, but you can also call it in.\nLuck is a mysterious thing.
M6120_S0210_G0030_001_resi=You defeated the Colosseum King huh. I thought he was a guy who could call in luck but......
M6120_S0210_G0040_001_resi=Well, he had no luck and you had luck. Is it just that simple?
M6120_S0220_G0000_001_resi=UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
M6120_S0220_G0010_001_resi=Phew, shouting loudly feels refreshing!!
M6120_S0220_G0020_001_resi=SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
M6120_S0220_G0030_001_resi=As expected, I can't stop shouting loudly! How about you join me?
M6120_S0220_G0040_001_resi=......Loud voice...... Too...... Much... Vocal cords...... Bro...... ken......
M6120_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Android-san, please, I have a request for you.
M6120_S0230_G0010_001_n02=My body is weak, and I probably cannot escape from this hell......
M6120_S0230_G0020_001_n02=Therefore, please, could you not kill me once and for all?
M6120_S0230_G0030_001_n02=I lost my family, I have nothing left anymore.
M6120_S0230_G0040_001_n02=Rather than receive eternal suffering in this hell......
M6120_S0230_G0050_001_n02=For you it might be an unpleasant request but......
M6120_S0230_G0060_001_n02=Please, please kill me......
M6120_S0240_G0000_001_toolshop=Oh, you're a new face.\nYou're gonna participate in a match, right? Then prepare here!!
M6120_S0240_G0010_001_toolshop=Eh, my way of speaking is strange?
M6120_S0240_G0020_001_toolshop=I learned from past literature, but apparently this is the language to skillfully conduct business.
M6120_S0240_G0030_001_toolshop=Eh, isn't it weird somewhere?
M6120_S0240_G0040_001_toolshop=I only just memorized it, don't worry about small things!!
M6120_S0240_G0050_001_toolshop=Welcome, look freely.
M6120_S0240_G0060_001_toolshop=Thank you always!
