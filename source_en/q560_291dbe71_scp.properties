M5560_S0010_G0000_001_dbl=Ah, right right. Won't you help us out a little with our work?
M5560_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=Wait, Devola...
M5560_S0010_G0020_001_dbl=It can't be helped, right? Ever since that damn huge "Tower" appeared, we're short on both materials and hands.
M5560_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=If we stay swamped with chores like this, we won't even be able to repair the Resistance members properly.
M5560_S0010_G0040_001_ppl=That is true, but...
M5560_S0010_G0050_001_dbl=So with that said, I'm asking you! Help us with the work.
M5560_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Help.
M5560_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Refuse.
M5560_S0010_G0080_001_dbl=Tch, stingy.
M5560_S0010_G0090_001_ppl=Devola... I'm sorry for asking the impossible. Please call out to us if you feel like it.
M5560_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=By the way, are you in the mood to help with the work?
M5560_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=Much appreciated! Well then, I need "Stripped Screws", "Small Gears", and "Machine Oil".
M5560_S0010_G0111_001_dbl=You should be able to get "Stripped Screws" from the Machine Lifeforms that are stacked up.
M5560_S0010_G0112_001_dbl=I think "Small Gears" can be taken from the small Machine Lifeforms with short legs.
M5560_S0010_G0113_001_ppl=I think "Machine Oil" was near the scrapped truck in the Abandoned Factory.
M5560_S0010_G0120_001_ppl=Please don't push yourself too hard.
M5560_S0010_G0130_001_dbl=Come to think of it, how are the requested items coming along?
M5560_S0010_G0140_001_ppl=It would be helpful if we had "Stripped Screws", "Small Gears", and "Machine Oil".
M5560_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=The materials Devola and the other asked for are gathered...
M5560_S0010_G0160_001_a2=The materials the red-haired twins asked for are gathered... Guess I'll go hand them over.
M5560_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=This is it! Thanks, you saved us.
M5560_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=Then Devola, let's get to work immediately.
M5560_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=...What on earth are you using those materials for?
M5560_S0030_G0030_001_a2=What are you guys making?
M5560_S0030_G0040_001_dbl=You can tell by looking, right? Daily necessities for the Camp.
M5560_S0030_G0050_001_ppl=Our work consists of a lot of odd jobs...
M5560_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Odd jobs...? Even though you possess that level of technical skill?
M5560_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Odd jobs, you say? Even with such high technical skill?
M5560_S0030_G0080_001_ppl=...It's fine. Because this is our job.
M5560_S0030_G0090_001_dbl=That's right. We have to be grateful just to have work.
M5560_S0030_G0100_001_dbl=This is a thank you. Please accept it.
M5560_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=No way, I can't accept this.
M5560_S0030_G0120_001_a2=I didn't work enough to receive this much.
M5560_S0030_G0130_001_dbl=It's fine. We have no way to use it anyway.
M5560_S0030_G0140_001_ppl=Please take it.
M5560_S0030_G0150_001_dbl=Help us out again, yeah?
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, looking for something?
