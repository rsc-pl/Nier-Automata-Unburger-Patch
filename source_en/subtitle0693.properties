M1090_S2000_H0030_001_a2b=...It's always... like this...
M1090_S2000_H0040_001_a2b=There are... still more...?
M1090_S2000_H0050_001_a2b=These... damn machines...
M1090_S2000_H0060_001_a2b=...Is this... a transmission...?
M1090_S2000_H0070_001_a2b=The data signals... they're resonating...

M1090_S2000_H0100_001_a2b=...You're...
M1090_S2000_H0110_001_a9s=It looks like I managed to leave my personal data on the machine network side.
M1090_S2000_H0120_001_a9s=Next thing I knew, my consciousness had reformed on their network.
M1090_S2000_H0130_001_a9s=Having multiple selves integrated like this is a valuable experience, so I want to record it, but I can't access the storage area yet. So for now,
M1090_S2000_H0140_001_a9s=I'll just multiplex and save it to the enemy memory around here, then when I can return to my own body...
M1090_S2000_H0150_001_a2b=9S...

M1090_S2000_H0190_001_a2b=What is it that separates Machine Lifeforms from us androids?
M1090_S2000_H0200_001_a9s=This battle will likely have a great impact on the war.
M1090_S2000_H0210_001_a2b=Robots that came to possess will and emotions.
M1090_S2000_H0220_001_a9s=The battle for 2B and myself will continue for a while longer, but...
M1090_S2000_H0230_001_a2b=Their final screams, uttered at the moment of death...
M1090_S2000_H0240_001_a9s=...that is another story.
M1090_S2000_H0250_001_a2b=Even now, it remains within me.
