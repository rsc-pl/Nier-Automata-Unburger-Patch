M6150_S0000_G0000_001_dreamR1=Good morning, Plato 1728.\nToday was your activation day, wasn't it.
M6150_S0000_G0010_001_dreamR1=Say, recently, even though I'm in sleep mode, I see images as if I'm active......
M6150_S0000_G0020_001_dreamR1=The images I see are different every time, ranging from fun things to sad things.
M6150_S0000_G0030_001_dreamR1=Sometimes I've even had experiences as if I became a human......
M6150_S0000_G0040_001_dreamR1=I wonder what that sensation that doesn't exist in this reality is......
M6150_S0000_G0050_001_dreamR1=Have you ever seen it?
M6150_S0010_G0000_001_dreamR2=This guy says he sees strange images during sleep mode recently.
M6150_S0010_G0010_001_dreamR2=Even if we inspect, there's no abnormality in the visual circuit, I wonder what it is.
M6150_S0020_G0000_001_restR=A large-scale great war seems near, and lately I'm tired from working non-stop......\nLet me rest just a little......
M6150_S0030_G0000_001_terminalR=It's troublesome that there are many individuals slacking on maintenance lately.
M6150_S0030_G0010_001_terminalR=Plato 1728, you are especially worn out so don't slack off.
M6150_S0040_G0000_001_watchR=The passage here broke, so I'm watching so no guys fall until it's repaired.
M6150_S0040_G0010_001_watchR=You are especially slow so be careful.
M6150_S0040_G0020_001_watchR=Not being able to fly in the sky, guys with legs are pitiful.
M6150_S0050_G0000_001_lookR=Recently there are many units hooked on that building with geometric patterns visible down there.
M6150_S0050_G0010_001_lookR=I wonder why?
M6150_S0060_G0000_001_attractR=Ah...... Plato 1728, you should try looking at that too.
M6150_S0060_G0010_001_attractR=How is it, seems like you'll be sucked in right?
M6150_S0070_G0000_001_frightenedR=Haa, I'm bad at combat training.
M6150_S0070_G0010_001_frightenedR=If my grades are bad next time too it's demotion, uuu just thinking about it makes my core hurt......
M6150_S0070_G0020_001_frightenedR=You are slow just like me so you understand this feeling right?
M6150_S0080_G0000_001_encourageR=What's the point of getting so nervous at training.
M6150_S0080_G0010_001_encourageR=Here, calm down and loosen your screws a little.
M6150_S0090_G0000_001_audienceR=Go! There! Get him!
M6150_S0100_G0000_001_audienceR=Break! Break! Break! Break! Break! Kill!
M6150_S0110_G0000_001_audienceR=Goooo!! You're a kid who can do it if you try!
M6150_S0120_G0000_001_questionR=Apparently lately, watching training at the combat training ground is the trend in this district.
M6150_S0120_G0010_001_questionR=I tried coming to watch too, but I don't get it at all.
M6150_S0120_G0020_001_questionR=More importantly, you are always slow and causing trouble on the battlefield, so train properly.
M6150_S0130_G0000_001_duskR=When I watch individuals of the same type as myself being made, I get a strange feeling.
M6150_S0130_G0010_001_duskR=I was born like this too, wasn't I.
M6150_S0140_G0010_001_badR=If it's the testing ground it's just past here, did your memory area finally break too?
M6150_S0150_G0000_001_badR=Yo, Plato 1728 today is the motor function test right?
M6150_S0150_G0010_001_badR=Since it's you, slow and worn out, surely you're dead last again today, hahaha.
M6150_S0160_G0000_001_difficultR=For my type with short legs, going down a ladder is a struggle.
M6150_S0160_G0010_001_difficultR=Haa, I'm nervous.
M6150_S0170_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=Upon the dawn this Giant Weapon is completed, we can wipe out those hateful androids!
M6150_S0170_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=Our victory is before our eyes!
M6150_S0180_G0000_001_childR=Wah, it's suuuper big.
M6150_S0180_G0010_001_childR=I wonder how many times my size it is.
M6150_S0190_G0000_001_lookR=I hope completion makes it in time for the next great war somehow.
M6150_S0200_G0000_001_restR=Haa I can't move anymore, the number of work robots is overwhelmingly insufficient.
M6150_S0200_G0010_001_restR=The guys at the top really don't understand anything about the site.\nI hope completion makes it in time for the next great war somehow......
M6150_S0210_G0000_001_restR=Ah, from looking at the terminal screen too much, even if I shut off my visual circuit I see round lights......
M6150_S0210_G0010_001_restR=..................It's a little fun.
M6150_S0220_G0000_001_duskR=Haa work work, I'm already tired. I'd rather just jump off from here.
M6150_S0230_G0000_001_terminalR=............Working now...... Be quiet......
M6150_S0240_G0000_001_terminalR=This goes here...... Okay perfect.
M6150_S0250_G0000_001_terminalR=Aaaaaaah, bugged again......\nBug bug bug bug bug......
M6150_S0260_G0000_001_terminalR=Deployment of a large-scale android unit can be seen in the flooded area.\nNearby squads please be vigilant.
M6150_S0270_G0000_001_terminalR=Even among Androids, the squad called YoRHa are specially atrocious guys.
M6150_S0270_G0010_001_terminalR=They have destroyed multiple squads many times with just one unit.
M6150_S0280_G0000_001_terminalR=If only the Giant Weapon is completed, we should be able to move the war situation at once.
M6150_S0290_G0000_001_terminalR=Consumption of electricity is intense this month......
M6150_S0290_G0010_001_terminalR=Hum, individuals wasting electricity stand out. I have to warn them once.
M6150_S0300_G0000_001_terminalR=This room is too noisy with bleeps and bloops.
M6150_S0310_G0000_001_terminalR=Tired, I feel like my core is being whittled away every time I press a button.
M6150_S0320_G0000_001_terminalR=Clearly understaffed......
M6150_S0330_G0000_001_terminalR=Tireeed......
M6150_S0340_G0000_001_terminalR=Why must we work......
M6150_S0350_G0000_001_terminalR=Just when I thought work was done, more work than that was piled up......
M6150_S0360_G0000_001_terminalR=Plato 1728 huh, hey listen to me.
M6150_S0360_G0010_001_terminalR=These past few months, I feel like my vision dropped from looking at the terminal screen too much so I'm thinking of trying to wear glasses.
M6150_S0360_G0020_001_terminalR=But, even if I try to wear glasses, machine me "has no eyes" (Me ga nee). Pupupu.
M6150_S0360_G0030_001_terminalR=How is it, it's the best right. This is a high-level communication technique humans used called "Gag".
M6150_S0360_G0040_001_terminalR=I learned it in past literature, but apparently those who could say Gags were worshipped as messengers of God. How is it, want to worship me?
M6150_S0360_G0050_001_terminalR=I want to wear glasses (Megane) but...... I have no eyes (Me ga nee)...... Pupupu.
M6150_S0370_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't think about anything, don't think about anything, you must not think......
M6150_S0370_G0010_001_terminalR=That's right, good, just move only your hands in this condition......
M6150_S0380_G0000_001_terminalR=This is 28th District Command Room, to ground squads.\nFor supply replenishment, please move to Point Zero.
M6150_S0390_G0000_001_terminalR=17th Squad, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0010_001_terminalR=No good...... The noise is terrible and I can't hear anything......
M6150_S0400_G0000_001_terminalR=Meteorite is running short. Have to ask the ground squad for replenishment.
M6150_S0410_G0000_001_terminalR=Supply replenishment hasn't been making it in time these past few months.\nThe influence of massive amounts of supplies being used for the Giant Weapon is big.
M6150_S0420_G0000_001_terminalR=My hands are already at the limit, maybe I should convert to combat type.
M6150_S0430_G0000_001_terminalR=Yes, after that please rendezvous with Delta Squad.
M6150_S0440_G0000_001_terminalR=When this is done I'll arrange supply replenishment, and next is regular contact with the ground squad and next is......
M6150_S0440_G0010_001_terminalR=When can I go home I wonder.
M6150_S0441_G0000_001_terminalR=2nd Platoon, please commence sortie.
M6150_S0442_G0000_001_terminalR=Shitty boss and shitty work and useless colleagues, utterly the worst workplace.
M6150_S0460_G0000_001_terminalR=Plato 1728 huh, do you have business in a place like this?\nIf I recall correctly today is your motor function test right. The exercise room is in Building 18.
M6150_S0460_G0010_001_terminalR=If you don't go quickly, you'll be scolded again. Do your best.
M6150_S0470_G0000_001_terminalR=YoRHa squad...... we must take some countermeasures......
M6150_S0480_G0000_001_terminalR=I wonder if the fighting won't end unless we annihilate the androids?
M6150_S0490_G0000_001_terminalR=Squads we can't contact increased again.
M6150_S0490_G0010_001_terminalR=Were they done in by the enemy, or perhaps desertion......
M6150_S0500_G0000_001_terminalR=Soldiers deserting have surged recently, we must take some countermeasures.
M6150_S0510_G0000_001_terminalR=..............................
M6150_S0530_G0000_001_terminalR=Apparently lately in a certain district something called Religion is popular.
M6150_S0540_G0000_001_terminalR=The air in this room is the worst.
M6150_S0550_G0000_001_terminalR=Apparently there is a Resistance base near the city outskirts.
M6150_S0550_G0010_001_terminalR=Can't we somehow calculate the precise position.
M6150_S0560_G0000_001_terminalR=Resistance androids aren't much individually, but their engineering activities cannot be underestimated.
M6150_S0565_G0000_001_terminalR=Good grief I want the war to end quickly......
M6150_S0570_G0000_001_terminalR=The anti-war faction guys are cowards.
M6150_S0570_G0010_001_terminalR=Androids are devils who kill defenseless brethren without mercy, we absolutely must exterminate them.
M6150_S0580_G0000_001_terminalR=Freeze again. This worn out terminal......
M6150_S0590_G0000_001_terminalR=To make us work on such worn out terminals, the upper echelon guys are truly stingy.
M6150_S0600_G0000_001_terminalR=All-nighter again today I guess......
M6150_S0610_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't talk to me, I get distracted.
M6150_S0620_G0000_001_terminalR=Everyone just complains whine whine whine whine, truly noisy.
M6150_S0620_G0010_001_terminalR=Can't they endure and work, good grief.
M6150_S0630_G0000_001_terminalR=Seems like I'll overheat......
M6150_S0640_G0000_001_bossR=Haa, it's you again. Do you understand the feeling of I who possess a useless subordinate?
M6150_S0640_G0010_001_bossR=I will be going home in a little bit but, of course you please work without going home today okay.
M6150_S0650_G0000_001_subordinateR=I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
M6150_S0650_G0010_001_subordinateR=The schedule seems like it will be delayed about a week.
M6150_S0655_G0000_001_lookR=I can't say it in a loud voice but, the boss next to me is the worst guy who pushes impossible schedules on subordinates and abuses them.
M6150_S0670_G0000_001_loafR2=Shh, quiet you'll be found!
M6150_S0680_G0000_001_putR=Even if I organize the room it gets dirtied immediately......
M6150_S0690_G0000_001_putR=Carried too many things, can't move anymore.
M6150_S0700_G0000_001_loafR2=Pretending to work, this is important.
M6150_S0710_G0000_001_loafR2=Too tired I see something. Is this, is this God!
M6150_S0720_G0000_001_restR=Please, overlook me. I don't want to work anymore.
M6150_S0740_G0000_001_frightenedR=............
