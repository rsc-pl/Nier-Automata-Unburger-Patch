M6010_S0090_G0060_300_op=You finally defeated Eve.
M6010_S0090_G0070_300_op=Thank you, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0080_300_op=You did well, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0090_300_op=Seriously, thank you so much~!
M6010_S0090_G0480_300_op=Ah! 2B-san! Did you get Eve's data!? Share it with me, quickly!
M6010_S0090_G0490_300_ys=Hey, hey, give her a break.
M6010_S0090_G0500_300_op=Good work. You're not tired, are you? Why don't you take some recovery medicine?
M6010_S0090_G0510_300_op=As much as you've accomplished, I think it should all be free.
M6010_S0090_G0630_300_ysA=Ugh, bleeegh...
M6010_S0090_G0640_300_ysB=Relax. Thanks to 2B and the others, our number of sorties should go down a bit.
M6010_S0090_G0650_300_ysA=R-Really!? Thank you so mu—bleeegh!
M6010_S0090_G0660_300_ysA=Thank you so mu—bleeegh!
M6010_S0090_G0670_300_ysA=I've got a great idea. How about we try transplanting Eve's self-regeneration function into the flight units?
M6010_S0090_G0680_300_ysB=Whoa! That could work! Zero repair costs!
M6010_S0090_G0690_300_op=That's obviously a terrible idea! Everyone would get contaminated by the virus and their bodies would be wrecked!
M6010_S0090_G0700_300_ysA=Haha, it's a joke, just a joke.
M6010_S0090_G0710_300_ysA=...Though I still think it was a good idea.
M6010_S0100_G0060_300_op=I'll support you with everything I've got. I wish you luck.
M6010_S0100_G0070_300_op=We can do this.
M6010_S0100_G0080_300_op=Let's end this. Our war.
M6010_S0100_G0090_300_op=I've fully tuned my information processing systems, so you can leave the support to me~!
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=I pray for your success.
M6010_S0100_G0450_300_ys=Roger.
M6010_S0100_G0460_300_op=Why don't you get your equipment in order before you deploy?
M6010_S0100_G0570_300_ysA=Ugh, bleeegh... I have to go... ugh, bleeegh...
M6010_S0100_G0580_300_ysB=Yeah, let's go. Don't vomit in space.
M6010_S0100_G0590_300_ysA=Shall we go too?
M6010_S0100_G0600_300_ysB=Yes.
M6010_S0100_G0610_300_op=Good fortune in battle.
