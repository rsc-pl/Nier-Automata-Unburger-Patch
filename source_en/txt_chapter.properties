CHAPTER_HELP_01_00=Tasked with destroying a Super-Large-Scale Weapon and gathering intelligence, 2B and 9S explore the Abandoned Factory from the inside and outside, respectively. They locate their target and engage, but 9S is gravely wounded while protecting 2B.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_00=Ordered to gather intelligence from the Resistance, 2B and 9S descend to the City Ruins. At the Resistance Camp, they offer their assistance to the androids struggling there.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_00=At Anemone's request, 2B and 9S head to the Desert Zone. The Machine Lifeforms there are capable of speech. Pursuing a fleeing unit deep into the desert, they encounter a Machine Lifeform that bears a striking resemblance to an android.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_00=To search for their comrades, 2B and 9S venture into the Amusement Park ruins. They receive a bizarre welcome from costumed Machine Lifeforms, before a "singing Machine Lifeform," adorned like a human, makes her appearance.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_00=A battle in the City Ruins causes a massive cave-in, which coincides with the reappearance of an alien signal. Heading underground, 2B and 9S discover the enemy mothership, where they once again encounter Adam and Eve.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_00=Acting on Pascal's intel, 2B and 9S head to the Forest Country. Inside the castle towering in the woods, they find the Forest King, only to see him destroyed by a female YoRHa android—a deserter named A2.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_00=To escort a supply convoy for an aircraft carrier, 2B and 9S visit the Flooded City. A report of an enemy attack comes in. As they sortie in their Flight Units to support allied forces, a colossal Machine Lifeform emerges from the ocean.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_00=During the battle with the colossal machine, 9S was blown away and went missing. While searching for him, 2B finds her way to a strange city made of pure white crystal, where Adam awaits her alone.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_00=To establish a peace treaty with a machine faction, 2B accompanies Pascal to the Abandoned Factory. There, they find a religious cult of machines who worship a god. The cult's mad dogma is soon turned upon them.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_00=A massive number of rampant Machine Lifeforms appear in the City Ruins. 2B and 9S move to intercept them. After destroying a Large-Scale Weapon before the Resistance Camp, a furious Eve emerges from the wreckage.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_00=With Adam and Eve defeated, YoRHa forces launch a full-scale assault on the Machine Lifeforms. However, the force is decimated by a massive logic virus outbreak. 2B and 9S barely survive, only for signs of the infection to appear in 2B herself...
CHAPTER_HELP_12_00=Pod 042 receives 2B's final directive: an order to provide support to A2. Ignoring A2's annoyance, the Pod doggedly follows her.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_00=After accessing the "Tower," 9S is directed toward a Resource Recovery Unit and steps inside the massive structure near the Forest Castle.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_00=The machines in Pascal's village suddenly go berserk. Responding to the call, A2 rushes to the village, evacuates Pascal and the children, and suppresses the enemy. Together, they fight off the machines at their evacuation point, but...
CHAPTER_HELP_15_00=The next Resource Recovery Unit 9S heads for has appeared in the Flooded City. Using his hacking skills, he obtains the second access key for the "Tower," but his own body is left unable to fight.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_00=Inside the Resource Recovery Unit, 9S fights the corrupted Operator 21O and is reunited with A2. Just as his rage turns toward A2, the intrusion of Machine Lifeforms shatters the situation.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_00=The "Tower," built by the Machine Lifeforms. Unaware of its purpose, 9S and A2 are drawn inside. What awaits them is a nightmarish truth prepared by the red girls.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_0=The YoRHa squad's descent operation commences. The objective is to locate and destroy a Super-Large-Scale Weapon. The force consists of a Flight Unit assault team supported by a single Scanner model.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_1=The YoRHa descent squad breaks through the atmosphere from orbit. Piloting her Flight Unit toward the Abandoned Factory, 2B watches as her comrades fall one by one...
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_2=9S's ground-level mission is to support the YoRHa assault squad by disabling the enemy base's defense systems. He boards his Flight Unit to make contact with the enemy defense units.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_0=2B and 9S meet once more. They split up to search the factory.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_1=2B touches down at the Abandoned Factory. A colossal defense weapon resembling a piece of heavy machinery lies in wait.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_2=9S destroys the giant defense weapon attacking 2B and appears before her. He proceeds to scout the factory's exterior in his Flight Unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_3=To search for the Super-Large-Scale Weapon, 2B infiltrates the factory interior.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_4=2B searched the factory but could not locate her target. Just as she was about to give up, two colossal defense weapons ambush her.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_0=It seemed as though 2B had defeated the giant defense weapons. But the two units merge with the factory's structure, revealing their true form at last.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_1=2B battles the Super-Large-Scale Weapon on a bridge. The size difference is overwhelming, and she is forced into a difficult fight.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_2=To support 2B, 9S attempts to hack the enemy's central nervous system. He is gravely wounded protecting her, but even so, uses his Pod to seize control of the machine's upper arm.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_3=Inheriting the Flight Unit from 9S, 2B launches an aerial assault against the Super-Large-Scale Weapon.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_0=2B and 9S destroyed the enemy swarm via a Black Box chain reaction. Though their bodies were lost, their uploaded data was transferred to new frames, allowing them to reactivate.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_1=2B awakens on the Bunker, the YoRHa forces' satellite base.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_2=To assist with 2B's boot-up sequence, 9S heads to her quarters.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_05_0=In the command room, the YoRHa Commander orders them to make contact with the Resistance on the surface and gather intelligence.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_01_0=They launch from the Bunker in their Flight Units and travel to the City Ruins. Landing on the surface, they visit the Resistance Camp and make contact with its leader, Anemone.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_02_0=2B and 9S leave the Resistance Camp to eliminate the Machine Lifeforms in the Desert Zone.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_01_0=2B and 9S begin eliminating their targets. Strangely, these particular Machine Lifeforms speak and wear clothing-like materials.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_02_0=In the ruins of what was once called the Mammoth Housing Complex, a staggering number of android corpses had been discarded.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_03_0=The Machine Lifeforms move bizarrely. They merge into a cocoon, from which a single man is born—a Machine Lifeform nearly identical to an android.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_04_0=After repelling the humanoid machine and escaping the collapsing cavern, 2B and 9S receive a transmission from the Bunker ordering them to search for a missing YoRHa unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_01_0=The trail of their comrade's signal leads to the eerie ruins of an amusement park. Machine Lifeforms dressed as clowns sing and dance with glee.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_02_0=In the amusement park's main square, 2B and 9S are welcomed by a Machine Lifeform shaped like an old-fashioned tank.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_03_0=2B and 9S enter the theater hall where their comrade's signal originates. In the dark theater, the stage curtain rises. A grotesque Machine Lifeform, adorned with android corpses, begins to sing.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_04_0=At the entrance to the Amusement Park ruins, a Machine Lifeform holding a white flag was waiting for them.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_01_0=Invited by the friendly Machine Lifeform, they meet an individual who calls himself Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_02_0=Upon leaving Pascal's village, they receive a report that Large-Scale Machine Lifeforms have appeared in the City Ruins. 2B and 9S acquire Flight Units to intercept them.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_03_0=A collapse of the underground caverns has drastically altered the City Ruins. Chasing a sudden alien signal, they head underground and find a facility that appears to be an alien mothership.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_04_0=Inside the mothership, they find only the desiccated corpses of aliens. Before the shocked androids can process this, the two machines from the desert cavern, Adam and Eve, appear.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_01_0=After Adam and Eve escape, 2B and 9S return to the Bunker. They report to the Commander what they learned: that the aliens were annihilated by the Machine Lifeforms.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_02_0=On the Commander's orders, 2B and 9S depart to gather intel on the Machine Lifeforms. Pascal tells them of a group of machines, independent of the network, who have formed a nation deep in the forest.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_03_0=Passing through the remains of a commercial facility, 2B and 9S enter the forest region. Armored Machine Lifeforms attack them, shouting cries of "For the King!"
CHAPTER_HELP_06_04_0=2B and 9S arrive at the Forest Castle. They fight their way through enemy machines and explore the castle's interior.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_05_0=Reaching the throne room, they find that the king is just a small, infant-like machine. As they stand there dumbfounded, a mysterious android suddenly appears before them.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_01_0=9S reports to Pascal about A2, the android from the Forest Castle. While Pascal's records do mention A2, they contain no information beyond her being a dangerous android.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_02_0=2B and 9S return to the Resistance Camp for self-data maintenance and resupply. At Anemone's request, they take on a mission to escort an android army aircraft carrier and head for the Flooded City.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_03_0=A report comes in that the carrier at sea is under attack. They receive Flight Units and move to eliminate the enemy forces.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_04_0=A Machine Lifeform of unprecedented size emerges from the sea. Hindered by its powerful electromagnetic barrier, 2B and 9S attempt to destroy it using interception cannons.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_0=The colossal Machine Lifeform is defeated. However, 9S has gone missing in the ensuing explosion. 2B frantically searches for him.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_1=2B awakens and begins searching for the missing 9S. To detect his faint Black Box signal, she obtains information from Anemone about a special scanner.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_2=Following 9S's signal, 2B wanders into a city of pure white crystal where Adam reappears. He created this city out of his interest in humanity and now challenges 2B to a fight to understand humanity's essence: "Death."
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_3=Damaged by the shock of the colossal machine's destruction, 9S wanders through his own memory banks.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_0=2B and Pascal visit the Abandoned Factory for peace talks, but are attacked by Machine Lifeforms before negotiations can even begin. Meanwhile, 9S is undergoing a systems check on the Bunker.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_1=Suspecting he may have been infected with a virus during his long captivity, 9S performs a systems check for a potential data overhaul.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_2=2B is on a mission to investigate the movements of machines disconnected from the network. She contacts Pascal, who reports that another group of machines has proposed a peace treaty.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_3=To negotiate peace with the machine faction, 2B meets Pascal at the entrance to the Abandoned Factory. Awaiting them inside is a group of robots who believe in a strange religion.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_0=To aid their escape, 9S hacks in from the Bunker.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_1=Waking in his room on the Bunker, 9S is informed by his operator that 2B has requested support. To assist her, he hacks into the Abandoned Factory via a large terminal.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_2=With 9S's support, 2B and Pascal attempt to escape from the Abandoned Factory.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_3=On their way out, 2B encounters a large multi-legged weapon. It is deploying a powerful energy shield that blocks all attacks. To disable it, 9S hacks into the factory's systems.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_0=After confirming the large multi-legged weapon's destruction, 9S disconnects. However, having learned the truth, he...
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_1=Having destroyed the large multi-legged weapon, 2B takes the elevator to the surface with Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_2=Summoned by the Commander, 9S reports the contradictions he found in the main server's records. The Commander reveals a shocking truth: humanity is extinct. 9S trembles.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_0=Receiving his combat deployment, 9S launches from the Bunker in his Flight Unit. On the surface, 2B is aiding the Resistance, who are under attack by rampant Machine Lifeforms.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_1=9S is bewildered by the truth of humanity's extinction. An emergency combat deployment order arrives as if to drown out his thoughts.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_2=Having safely escaped the Abandoned Factory with Pascal, 2B receives a rescue request from Anemone at the Resistance Camp.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_3=Arriving at the Resistance Camp, 2B witnesses a machine devouring androids. The enemy is deploying an energy shield that deflects projectiles, forcing 2B to rely on melee attacks to destroy it.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_4=Waiting in the City Ruins was a large multi-legged weapon that attacked with electrical discharges.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_02_0=9S arrives mid-battle with the multi-legged weapon. Detaching his Flight Unit, he crashes it directly into the enemy. The weapon falls silent, but from its wreckage, Eve emerges.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_03_0=Receiving a distress call from Pascal, 2B and 9S rush to his village. A horde of rampant Machine Lifeforms had descended upon it.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_04_0=Having lost Adam, Eve's hatred has driven him berserk, causing all machines under the network to go rampant as well. They will not stop until Eve is stopped. 2B and 9S steel themselves for the final battle.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_0=When Eve is severed from the network, 9S suffers physical corruption. To save him, 2B makes the decision to kill him with her own hands...
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_1=The battle surrounding Adam and Eve reaches its conclusion. Though the war between androids and machines rages on, for now, 2B and 9S simply savor the fact that they are alive.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_2=2B returns to the Bunker with 9S. Donning her combat armor, she throws herself into a new battle...
CHAPTER_HELP_11_01_0=With the defeat of the network's core units, "Adam" and "Eve," the Machine Lifeforms' command structure has fallen into chaos. Seizing this opportunity, the Army of Humanity deploys a large-scale ground invasion.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_02_0=To paralyze the machines' anti-air systems, 9S is tasked with hacking them alongside a Scanner unit squad.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_03_0=As a mobile support unit, 2B and 9S provide aid to the vanguard forces capturing various territories.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_04_0=Triggered by an enemy EMP attack, the YoRHa forces are corrupted by a virus. 2B and 9S are forced to turn their blades on their own comrades.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_05_0=2B awakens in her bed on the Bunker. She and 9S report the situation to the Commander, but the Bunker is already virally contaminated. The Commander chooses to go down with her ship.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_06_0=2B escapes the Bunker, but is shot down by YoRHa forces and crashes to the surface. As she faces the advancing machines, she realizes her own body is beginning to succumb to the virus.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_07_0=Having landed on the surface, 9S follows 2B's Black Box signal to her location. What he finds there is A2, and... the final moments of 2B.
CHAPTER_HELP_12_01_0=A2 awakens in the ruins of the commercial facility. Annoyed by the Pod tailing her, she heads for the Desert Zone to destroy a Large-Scale Machine Lifeform.
CHAPTER_HELP_12_02_0=After defeating the machine in the desert, a deflated A2 watches as a massive linked Machine Lifeform emerges from the sand. Hard-pressed, she activates B-Mode to destroy it.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_01_0=9S had been knocked unconscious by the collapsing terrain. He awakens in the Resistance Camp, tended to by Devola and Popola.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_02_0=9S heads to the massive structure that appeared in the City Ruins. Accessing its system, an automated voice announces a tour of the "Resource Recovery Unit."
CHAPTER_HELP_13_03_0=On his way from the "Tower" to the Resource Recovery Unit, 9S resolves to annihilate the Machine Lifeforms and kill A2.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_04_0=9S arrives at the base of the Resource Recovery Unit. Boarding the defended structure, he heads for the upper floors to obtain the "Access Key."
CHAPTER_HELP_14_01_0=Overloaded from the battle with the Large-Scale Machine Lifeform, A2 shuts down and reboots. She heads to the Resistance Camp to replace a degraded fuel filter, where Anemone tells her to trade with Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_02_0=Pascal is looking after the children. A precious, ordinary day... until a sinister sound from afar threatens to shatter their peace.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_03_0=A2 obtains the materials Pascal requested. Just as she is about to head to the village to deliver them, she receives a communication from Pascal, his tone deeply unsettled.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_04_0=Arriving at Pascal's village, A2 witnesses Machine Lifeforms cannibalizing each other.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_05_0=Pascal and the village children had evacuated to the Abandoned Factory. A2 arrives, but learns of a massive enemy force gathering and moves to intercept. After the battle, a truly cruel fate awaits them.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_01_0=Though his Pod warns him of vital sign abnormalities, 9S ignores it and hurries to the next Resource Recovery Unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_02_0=9S boards the Resource Recovery Unit in the Flooded City. He can't detect any enemies inside. This unit is designed so that its core cannot be reached without hacking through its system protections.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_03_0=9S's NFCS (Near-Field Combat System) has malfunctioned. Unable to fight or even run properly, he heads for the Resistance Camp to have Devola repair it.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_04_0=9S reaches the Resistance Camp. Though Devola and Popola are worried, their words do not reach him.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_01_1=With his repairs complete, 9S departs for the next Resource Recovery Unit, heading toward the Amusement Park ruins.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_01_2=Leaving the Abandoned Factory, A2 is guided by the "Tower" system service announcements ringing through the sky, and heads for the large eastern unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_02_0=Inside the Resource Recovery Unit, Machine Lifeforms unleashing a barrage of ranged attacks lie in wait. Destroying them as he proceeds, 9S has an unexpected reunion.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_03_0=Operator 21O, whom 9S failed to kill, is finished off by A2. 9S turns his fury on A2, but the appearance of a new enemy causes him to fall to a lower level. A2 engages the machine's brothers in combat.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_01_0=9S awakens to the sound of his Pod. With all authentication keys in hand, he heads for the "Tower's" entrance. When he unlocks it, a horde of enemies appears, but Devola and Popola arrive to back him up.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_02_0=Thanks to Devola and Popola's sacrifice, 9S finally enters the "Tower." The "entertainment" it has prepared is the one thing 9S despises most... 2B-type androids.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_03_0=A2 leaves the Resource Recovery Unit in the Amusement Park ruins. Hearing from her Pod that the "Tower" gate has been opened, she makes for the entrance.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_04_0=Having infiltrated the "Tower," A2 explores its interior and finds herself in a vast, white library.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_05_0=Having lost his left arm, 9S grafts one from a 2B copy. However, a virus enters his system from the arm, forcing him to self-hack to remove it. As he continues the fight, girls in red dresses appear before him.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_06_0=A2 defeats the large multi-legged weapon that appeared in the library. As she takes the elevator to the "Tower's" upper levels, she is forcibly hacked. In cyberspace, the red girls challenge her to a fight.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_07_0=9S steals a Flight Unit from the corrupted YoRHa and aims for the "Tower's" peak. A2 fights a large multi-legged weapon on the ascending elevator.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_08_0=9S and A2 reach the summit of the "Tower." A massive multi-legged machine, formed from two units joined as one, stands before them.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_09_0=With the Machine Lifeform destroyed, 9S and A2 confront each other. A2 tries to argue the meaninglessness of them killing one another, but her words cannot reach a 9S consumed by hatred. And so, the deathmatch between the last remaining YoRHa units begins.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_0=9S and A2 meet their respective ends.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_1=9S slashes at A2, who counters. For a moment, A2 hears 2B's voice in her mind and her hand falters. As she is stabbed, she falls, plunging her own sword into 9S...
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_2=Having defeated 9S, A2 enters his system to remove the viral corruption.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_11_0=The Black Box signals of all YoRHa units have ceased. The Pods shift Project YoRHa into its final phase.
