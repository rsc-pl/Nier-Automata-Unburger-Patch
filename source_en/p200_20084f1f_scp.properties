M1050_S0005_G0000_001_op60=2B-san! This is Operator 6O.
M1050_S0005_G0001_001_a9s=Going back this way again... it's a hassle, isn't it.
M1050_S0005_G0002_001_a2b=Don't complain. 9S.
M1050_S0005_G0003_001_a9s=Yees.
M1050_S0005_G0010_001_op60=We have confirmed the deployment and operation of a transfer device in the City Ruins.
M1050_S0005_G0010_300_jackas=Transfer should be enabled on other terminals too. Use them as you like.
M1050_S0005_G0011_300_jackas=You seem... to be active in various places.
M1050_S0005_G0012_300_jackas=Don't praise me. I'll blush.
M1050_S0005_G0020_001_op60=Other points are also being prepared.
M1050_S0005_G0030_001_a9s=Finally, we can use transfer devices.
M1050_S0005_G0040_001_a2b=Transfer device?
M1050_S0005_G0050_001_a9s=Yes... it's a device that transfers self-data to a temporary \nbody in the Bunker while leaving the body on the surface.
M1050_S0005_G0060_001_a9s=I heard about it from people in the Technology Department, but it's finally been put to practical use.
M1050_S0005_G0070_001_a9s=I'll point the position data on the map.
M1050_S0005_G0071_001_jackas=Yo. How are you?
M1050_S0005_G0072_001_a2b=You are...
M1050_S0005_G0073_001_jackas=Your Commander told me to, \nso I made a new access point.
M1050_S0005_G0074_001_jackas=I made it so the transfer device works too.
M1050_S0005_G0075_001_a9s=Ah, thank you very much.
M1050_S0005_G0076_001_jackas=The Commander is an old acquaintance, \nbut she really makes people work too much~
M1050_S0005_G0077_001_jackas=Complain to her for me next time you meet her.
M1050_S0005_G0080_001_a2b=This is the transfer device...
M1050_S0005_G0100_001_a9s=But, if we have a transfer device...
M1050_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=It's convenient because we don't have to go back \nand forth between the Bunker and surface with flight units every time.
M1050_S0005_G0120_001_a9s=Flight units have high operational costs, \nand there is also the danger of being attacked.
