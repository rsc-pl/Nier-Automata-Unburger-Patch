M5680_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Hello! You are androids, right?
M5680_S0010_G0010_001_n02=The world is overflowing with love, isn't it?
M5680_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Might be so...
M5680_S0010_G0030_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0040_001_n02=Don't you think we should express our own joy more?
M5680_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Maybe we should...
M5680_S0010_G0060_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0070_001_n02=That's right! Then...
M5680_S0010_G0080_001_n02=To make this world even better, won't you help us a little?
M5680_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Help...
M5680_S0010_G0100_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0110_001_n02=...Really?
M5680_S0010_G0120_001_n02=Really, the world connects with love... do you believe such dreamy things?
M5680_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Believe.
M5680_S0010_G0140_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Is that so...
M5680_S0010_G0170_001_n02=Is that so... If it's you, you seem able to believe.
M5680_S0010_G0180_001_n02=Actually, even among us Machine Lifeforms, there are many who hate fighting.
M5680_S0010_G0190_001_n02=I decided to gather such comrades and hold a parade.
M5680_S0010_G0200_001_n02=That is, a Parade of Love, sharing friendship.
M5680_S0010_G0210_001_n02=However, there are also many who hate peace activities like ours.
M5680_S0010_G0220_001_n02=Please... won't you protect us so our parade succeeds?
M5680_S0010_G0230_001_sele=Protect.
M5680_S0010_G0240_001_sele=Do not protect.
M5680_S0010_G0250_001_n02=That is unfortunate. If you feel like cooperating, please ask then.
M5680_S0010_G0260_001_n02=As proof of friendship, I want to conduct a parade to the Resistance Camp. Won't you cooperate?
M5680_S0010_G0270_001_n02=Grateful for your cooperation!
M5680_S0010_G0280_001_n02=Well then, I would be happy if you could guard us while our comrades conduct the parade!
M5680_S0010_G0290_001_n02=Well then... LET'S! FRIENDSHIP!!
M5680_S0020_G0000_001_robos=LET'S SHARE JOY!!
M5680_S0020_G0010_001_robos=LET'S STOP FIGHTING!!
M5680_S0020_G0020_001_robos=LET'S SCATTER LOVE!!
M5680_S0020_G0030_001_robos=LET'S LIVE FUNLY!!
M5680_S0020_G0040_001_robos=LET'S THROW AWAY HATRED!!
M5680_S0020_G0050_001_n02=Hiii! Please help! Please help!
M5680_S0020_G0060_001_n02=We did not come to fight!
M5680_S0020_G0070_001_n02=Please help!!
M5680_S0020_G0080_001_n02=We need LOVE!!
M5680_S0020_G0090_001_n02=Noooooooo!
M5680_S0020_G0100_001_n02=Heeeeeelp!!
M5680_S0020_G0110_001_n02=I hate fighting!
M5680_S0020_G0120_001_n02=JOY!
M5680_S0020_G0130_001_n02=Thank you very much.
M5680_S0020_G0140_001_n02=Thanks to you, the parade avoided annihilation.
M5680_S0020_G0150_001_n02=This... it's small, but it's a thanks. Please take it.
M5680_S0020_G0160_001_n02=Ugh... Why such violence...
M5680_S0020_G0170_001_n02=But... I won't give up. I'll do it, one more time...!
M5680_S0020_G0180_001_n02=This time for sure... I want to realize a parade that makes the world peaceful.
M5680_S0020_G0190_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5680_S0020_G0200_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5680_S0040_G0030_001_n02=Don't say that, come on, let's go!
M5680_S0040_G0060_001_n02=We succeeded in conveying Joy this time too!
M5680_S0040_G0070_001_n02=We plan to conduct a parade in another place again next time. I'm counting on you again then!
M5680_S0040_G0080_001_n02=Um...
M5680_S0040_G0090_001_n02=Do you think of us as fools?
M5680_S0040_G0100_001_n02=...
M5680_S0040_G0110_001_n02=...Excuse me, please definitely help again.
M5680_S0050_G0000_001_n02=...Ah, it's you.
M5680_S0050_G0010_001_n02=I can't keep up with them anymore.
M5680_S0050_G0020_001_n02=What joy... What love. No matter how many lives you have, it's not enough for that.
M5680_S0050_G0030_001_n02=Eh? You ask where the group doing the parade went?
M5680_S0050_G0040_001_n02=If it's them, they set off saying "Joy even to the ends of the world"...
M5680_S0050_G0050_001_n02=At the ends of the desert, contact was cut off.
M5680_S0050_G0060_001_n02=Stupid bunch... Surely, they are dying like dogs by the roadside.
M5680_S0050_G0070_001_n02=Love, or joy... Ridiculous.
