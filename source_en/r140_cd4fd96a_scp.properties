M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=We won't fight! We won't fight!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill us! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We haven't done anything bad...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M3060_S0036_G0050_001_a9s=......
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=...I heard my little sister was found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=To think she would stop moving before me...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5221_S0030_G0130_001_robochild=Thank you!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such valuable information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is a token of gratitude. Please accept it.
M5802_S0010_G0230_001_robomother=Ah... I wonder when he started saying such admirable things...
M5802_S0010_G0240_001_robomother=This is also thanks to you. Thank you very much!
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Ugh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is exactly as Sartre says.
M6050_S0010_G1840_300_villager=Hello. \nIt seems there are no abnormalities in the village today either.
M6050_S0010_G1850_300_villager=Please stretch your legs and relax as much as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1860_300_villager=It's a place with nothing, but having nothing is its feature.
M6050_S0010_G1870_300_villager=If you walk around slowly, it will be a change of pace.
M6050_S0010_G1880_300_kj=Is there something you're interested in?
M6050_S0010_G1890_300_kj=I have a promise to meet the guy in the forest soon.
M6050_S0010_G1900_300_kj=He's the guy who taught me craftsmanship, so I guarantee his skill.
M6050_S0010_G1910_300_kj=Come show your face again.
M6050_S0010_G1920_300_ps=Look around as much as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1930_300_ps=Come again.
M6050_S0010_G1950_300_villager=...When I woke up from sleeping, my torsos had decreased again.
M6050_S0010_G1960_300_villager=I heard that guy picked one up and increased his, so I have to go search again too.
M6050_S0010_G1970_300_villager=Searching for parts isn't easy either.
M6050_S0010_G1980_300_villager=Look look, my torsos increased again.
M6050_S0010_G1990_300_villager=I found the parts outside the village.
M6050_S0010_G2000_300_villager=It-It's true!
M6050_S0010_G2010_300_villager=Just one more and I can become the three-tiered belly I yearn for.
M6050_S0010_G2020_300_villager=Recently, I haven't seen the animals of the forest.
M6050_S0010_G2030_300_villager=I hope everyone is doing well.
M6050_S0010_G2040_300_villager=The current you has the same smell as me.
M6050_S0010_G2050_300_villager=I don't mean the smell of machine oil.
M6050_S0010_G2060_300_villager=To come to my place, you are an odd one.
M6050_S0010_G2070_300_villager=There is nothing interesting here, but if it's just talking, I can do that.
M6050_S0010_G2080_300_pascal=I observed a large explosion far up in the sky.
M6050_S0010_G2090_300_pascal=I thought "what if"... was it a place connected to you all?
M6050_S0010_G2100_300_pascal=I don't think this village can serve as a substitute, but we will welcome you anytime.
M6050_S0010_G2110_300_pascal=Please think of it as your own village and take your time.
M6050_S0010_G2120_300_villager=Have you been well?
M6050_S0010_G2130_300_villager=I have been more well!
M6050_S0010_G2140_300_villager=Will you play together too?
M6050_S0010_G2150_300_villager=Uncle Pascal said that health is number one!
M6050_S0010_G2160_300_villager=Will you play together and get healthy too?
M6050_S0010_G2170_300_villager=Since they insisted, I decided to play together with them.
M6050_S0010_G2180_300_villager=Good grief, what helpless guys.
M6050_S0010_G2190_300_villager=So, what are we playing today? Tag, or Hide-and-Seek, either is fine?
M6050_S0010_G2240_300_villager=I've gotten tired of the view from here too.
M6050_S0010_G2250_300_villager=I'm thinking of trying to take a walk for the first time in a while.
M6050_S0010_G2260_300_villager=When you are flying in the sky all the time, there are times when you want a change of pace, right.
M6050_S0010_G2270_300_villager=Soon, I am thinking of setting up a residence.
M6050_S0010_G2280_300_villager=I saw the sky flash with light!
M6050_S0010_G2290_300_villager=Is that the thing called a Shooting Star from the rumors?! I gotta make a wish!
M6050_S0010_G2300_300_villager=...May I live happily with everyone in the village forever.
M6050_S0010_G2420_300_villager=I haven't played enough yet!
M6050_S0010_G2430_300_villager=What to do next? What to play?
M6050_S0010_G2440_300_villager=Let's do the one where Daruma-san falls down!
M6050_S0010_G2450_300_villager=Even for me with a big body, there are things I can do, right?
M6050_S0010_G2460_300_villager=If push comes to shove... I will fight for everyone.
M6050_S0010_G2470_300_villager=My neck got tired from looking up all the time.
M6050_S0010_G2480_300_villager=...Where is my neck, I wonder.
M6050_S0010_G2490_300_villager=This world is too small for me...
M6050_S0010_G2500_300_villager=...My neck is getting tired.
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible.
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. It's nice weather today too, isn't it.
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you have any business, please say so.
M6050_S0010_G3100_300_villager=Being carried was fun, so it seems I unintentionally asked for too much. I don't have arms, so I couldn't realize it.
M6050_S0010_G3110_300_villager=We were able to make up, but I wonder if he'll increase the number of times he carries me if I give him oil to apply to his arms...
M6050_S0010_G3120_300_villager=Playing alone isn't fun after all.
M6050_S0010_G3130_300_villager=That's why I decided to make up. However, carrying is limited to three locations a day.
