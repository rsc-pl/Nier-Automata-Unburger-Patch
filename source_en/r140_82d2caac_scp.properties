M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=STOP! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=WE WON'T FIGHT! WE WON'T FIGHT!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=DON'T KILL US! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We didn't do anything wrong...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=WE'RE SORRY! WE'RE SORRY!
M5040_S0010_G0145_001_papa=Please, you have to save my child...
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=...They said my little sister was found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=To think she would stop moving before I did...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such precious information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is a small token of my gratitude. Please, accept it.
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Oh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is as Sartre-san says.
M6050_S0010_G1270_300_villager=A little while ago, I heard a terrible sound from the City Ruins.
M6050_S0010_G1280_300_villager=N-No matter what happens, I'll protect the village...!
M6050_S0010_G1290_300_villager=B-But I hope the shift change comes soon.
M6050_S0010_G1300_300_villager=This place should be safe... Probably.
M6050_S0010_G1310_300_villager=I heard a loud noise in the distance.
M6050_S0010_G1320_300_villager=Are you alright?
M6050_S0010_G1330_300_villager=Please, make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G1340_300_kj=That was a huge earthquake. You okay?
M6050_S0010_G1350_300_kj=They say if you're prepared, there's nothin' to worry 'bout. Look around as much as ya like.
M6050_S0010_G1360_300_kj=I hope that fella in the forest is alright, too...
M6050_S0010_G1370_300_kj=You can come look anytime.
M6050_S0010_G1380_300_sp=Oh my, you're safe. I am so happy to see you again.
M6050_S0010_G1390_300_sp=Would you care to look at anything?
M6050_S0010_G1400_300_sp=Please come visit me anytime.
M6050_S0010_G1430_300_villager=The earthquake startled me so much I dropped one of my torsos.
M6050_S0010_G1440_300_villager=This is a problem... Where on earth could it have gone.
M6050_S0010_G1450_300_villager=A torso fell off, so I picked it up!
M6050_S0010_G1460_300_villager=Hehe, I wonder if this makes me look cooler!
M6050_S0010_G1470_300_villager=It's still not enough... I want more.
M6050_S0010_G1480_300_villager=I heard a really loud noise, so I came to check on the forest.
M6050_S0010_G1490_300_villager=I hope the forest creatures weren't too startled.
M6050_S0010_G1500_300_villager=When one faces danger alone, one becomes strong.
M6050_S0010_G1510_300_villager=The solitary man is the only true warrior.
M6050_S0010_G1520_300_villager=But, I suppose it's fine if you come to play once in a while.
M6050_S0010_G1530_300_pascal=Ah, you are safe. There was a very large earthquake, so I was worried.
M6050_S0010_G1540_300_pascal=I am glad that neither the villagers nor you were injured.
M6050_S0010_G1550_300_villager=We don't have much, but please make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G1560_300_villager=I heard a super loud sound! It was scary, but also a little fun!
M6050_S0010_G1570_300_villager=What should I play next, I wonder.
M6050_S0010_G1580_300_villager=It shook so much! What a huge sound!
M6050_S0010_G1590_300_villager=Let's play, but be a little careful.
M6050_S0010_G1600_300_villager=That was a very large earthquake...
M6050_S0010_G1610_300_villager=Were you okay? I'm okay.
M6050_S0010_G1650_300_villager=In my house, everything is within arm's reach.
M6050_S0010_G1660_300_villager=It's a comfortable life with no inconveniences whatsoever.
M6050_S0010_G1670_300_villager=I don't own a house.
M6050_S0010_G1680_300_villager=It has its inconveniences, but my heart is always free.
M6050_S0010_G1690_300_villager=It seems there was an explosion far away. Were you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1700_300_villager=You shouldn't get too close to dangerous places.
M6050_S0010_G1770_300_villager=Hmm.
M6050_S0010_G1780_300_villager=...Right now, I'm thinking of a game that even someone with short legs can play.
M6050_S0010_G1790_300_villager=At this point, maybe Tag is fine.
M6050_S0010_G1800_300_villager=Tag's not so bad, is it.
M6050_S0010_G1810_300_villager=Just 'cause my body's big doesn't mean I'm strong...
M6050_S0010_G1820_300_villager=Dammit... If only my body were big like that guy's...
M6050_S0010_G1830_300_villager=More... Grant me a larger body...
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible!
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Another fine day, isn't it?
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you need anything, please let me know.
M6050_S0010_G3070_300_villager=I've had my fill of this place, so I'd like to go somewhere else soon,\nbut my ride is taking forever to get here.
M6050_S0010_G3080_300_villager=Honestly, what a slacker, being late for our promised time. \nThen again, maybe he's mad 'cause I asked him to carry me around too much.
M6050_S0010_G3090_300_villager=Got tired from carrying my friend. \nTaking a short break. I'm on break, on break.
