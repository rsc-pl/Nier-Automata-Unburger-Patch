M1080_S0030_G0000_101_ane=I see... It was rough for 9S.
M1080_S0030_G0010_101_ane=As requested, I'll launch him up to your Command, body and all.
M1080_S0030_G0020_101_a2b=Thank you...
M1080_S0030_G0030_101_ane=Eh!?
M1080_S0030_G0040_101_a2b=What is it?
M1080_S0030_G0050_101_ane=It's unexpected to hear such words from your mouth.
M1080_S0030_G0060_101_a2b=...
M1080_S0030_G0070_101_ane=Well, fine.
M1080_S0030_G0080_101_ane=Oh, also, I have a message.
M1080_S0030_G0090_101_ane=Your Command wants you to contact them.
M1080_S0030_G0100_101_a2b=Understood.
M1080_S0030_G0110_101_a2b=This is 2B. Connect me to the Commander.
M1080_S0030_G0120_101_op60=Ah, 2B-san. Roger that.
M1080_S0030_G0130_101_op60=Please wait a moment...
M1080_S0030_G0140_101_cmd=2B.
M1080_S0030_G0150_101_cmd=Good work on the destruction of the enemy Machine Lifeform... Codename "Adam".
M1080_S0030_G0160_101_cmd=Analysis has revealed that Adam was managing half of their network systems.
M1080_S0030_G0170_101_cmd=With their network destroyed, the Machine Lifeforms should be weakened.
M1080_S0030_G0180_101_a2b=Commander. How is 9S?
M1080_S0030_G0190_101_cmd=We will perform a data overhaul for 9S here.
M1080_S0030_G0200_101_cmd=If there are no problems, I plan to have him accompany you again.
M1080_S0030_G0210_101_a2b=Please take care of him.
M1080_S0030_G0220_101_cmd=While 9S is unable to move, I want to entrust you with another mission.
M1080_S0030_G0230_101_cmd=I've mailed you the details, so please check them.
M1080_S0030_G0240_101_a2b=Roger.
M1080_S0030_G0250_101_a2b=Trends among the Machine Lifeforms, huh...
M1080_S0030_G0260_101_a2b=Even so, if I met them, I'd probably just kill them immediately...
M1080_S0030_G0270_101_pod042=Proposal: Obtain information from the same species, Machine Lifeform "Pascal".
M1080_S0030_G0280_101_a2b=I see. Pascal might know something.
M1080_S0030_G0290_101_a2b=Hello... Can you hear me? Pascal.
M1080_S0030_G0300_101_pascal=Ah... 2B-san. What is the matter?
M1080_S0030_G0310_101_a2b=If you've noticed anything regarding recent trends among Machine Lifeforms, please tell me.
M1080_S0030_G0320_101_pascal=Recent trends among Machine Lifeforms?
M1080_S0030_G0330_101_pascal=Come to think of it, two days ago, there was contact regarding a peace treaty
M1080_S0030_G0340_101_pascal=from Machine Lifeforms that disconnected from the central network.
M1080_S0030_G0350_101_a2b=A peace treaty?
M1080_S0030_G0360_101_pascal=Yes, those who escaped the network's control want to form an alliance with this village.
M1080_S0030_G0370_101_a2b=Then, couldn't they just join Pascal's village...?
M1080_S0030_G0380_101_pascal=No, it seems they have already built a large colony.
M1080_S0030_G0390_101_a2b=A colony?
M1080_S0030_G0400_101_pascal=Yes. It seems they have taken refuge in the Abandoned Factory.
M1080_S0030_G0410_101_pascal=If you are interested, I will transfer the location.
M1080_S0030_G0420_101_a2b=Please.
M1080_S0030_G0430_101_pascal=I was also thinking I had to go speak with them soon.
M1080_S0030_G0440_101_pascal=Let's meet up at the site.
M1080_S0030_G0450_101_a2b=Roger.
M1080_S0030_G0460_101_pascal=2B-san. Hello.
M1080_S0030_G0470_101_pascal=Well then, shall we go?
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Notification of mail received from Access Point.
M5920_S0010_G0281_001_pod042=Obtained information on target location. Marking on map.
