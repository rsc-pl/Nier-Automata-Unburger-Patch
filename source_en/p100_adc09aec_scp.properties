M1030_S0400_G0250_001_a2b=What is that...?
M1030_S0400_G0260_001_a9s=Ah, I guess you haven't seen one before, 2B.
M1030_S0400_G0270_001_a9s=That is launching supplies from the surface up to\nthe Bunker and the human bases on the moon.
M1030_S0400_G0280_001_a9s=Since there aren't any materials or fuel in space.
M1030_S0400_G0290_001_a2b=I see.
M1030_S0400_G0300_001_a2b=...I wonder why the Machine Lifeforms, or the Aliens that created them, don't attack the Bunker directly.
M1030_S0400_G0310_001_a2b=Even though they're supposed to have come from space originally...
M1030_S0400_G0320_001_a9s=There has been a lot of debate regarding the reason for that,
M1030_S0400_G0330_001_a9s=but no conclusion has been reached.
M1030_S0400_G0340_001_a9s=I don't really understand what Aliens are thinking.
