M1080_S0070_G0000_101_a2b=These guys...!
M1080_S0070_G0010_101_pascal=It seems my prediction was right on the mark, as I thought.
M1080_S0070_G0020_101_pascal=However, this is fascinating...
M1080_S0070_G0030_101_pascal=I have never seen Machine Lifeforms holding such peculiar ideology.
M1080_S0070_G0040_101_pascal=Surely, as valuable samples...
M1080_S0070_G0050_101_a2b=Forget that, run!
M1080_S0070_G0050_300_a9s=2B, please don't be reckless. \nLet's meet up again later.
M1080_S0070_G0060_101_a2b=Bunker! This is 2B.
M1080_S0070_G0070_101_a2b=Encountered hostile Machine Lifeforms at the Abandoned Factory site.
M1080_S0070_G0080_101_a2b=Requesting the securing of an escape route!
M1080_S0070_G0081_101_prst=You too must die and become God!
M1080_S0070_G0082_101_prst=The world after death is wonderful!
M1080_S0070_G0083_101_prst=Dying is the final tranquility!
M1080_S0070_G0084_101_prst=Die and become God!
M1080_S0070_G0085_101_prst=Let us all become God together!
M1080_S0070_G0086_101_prst=We too shall become God! We shall!
M1080_S0070_G0090_101_op60=Bu...nker. 2B-sa...copy?
M1080_S0070_G0100_101_pod042=Communication environment is unstable.
M1080_S0070_G0110_101_a2b=Loop the distress signal!
M1080_S0070_G0120_101_pod042=Roger.
M1080_S0070_G0130_101_a2b=Shit!
M1080_S0070_G0140_101_a2b=It's blocked off...
M1080_S0070_G0150_101_pascal=2B-san! It seems the gate at the back of the room has opened.
M1080_S0070_G0160_101_pascal=Let's go check it.
M1080_S0070_G0170_101_a2b=
M1080_S0070_G0180_101_rbot9s=Wait wait wait! 2B!
M1080_S0070_G0190_101_rbot9s=It's me! It's 9S!
M1080_S0070_G0200_101_a2b=...9S!?
M1080_S0070_G0210_101_a9s=I am hacking from the Bunker and controlling this Machine Lifeform.
M1080_S0070_G0220_101_a9s=I'm going to intrude into the factory's system now and get the two of you out!
M1080_S0070_G0230_101_a2b=Understood. Please!
