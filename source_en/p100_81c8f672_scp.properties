M1030_S0500_S0000_201_eve=Hey... Nii-chan.
M1030_S0500_S0010_201_eve=Why do we have to wear something as annoying as underwear?
M1030_S0500_S0020_201_adam=According to the records, humans lived their lives with their groins covered.
M1030_S0500_S0030_201_adam=Exposing one's groin was apparently considered... a problematic act.
M1030_S0500_S0040_201_adam=Shut up and put it on, Eve.
M1030_S0500_S0050_201_eve=Okay...
M1030_S0500_S0060_201_eve=But why do we have to eat this plant?
M1030_S0500_S0070_201_eve=We Machine Lifeforms can move without eating stuff like this.
M1030_S0500_S0080_201_adam=This is a type of fruit.
M1030_S0500_S0090_201_adam=Apparently, humans were able to obtain intelligence by eating it.
M1030_S0500_S0100_201_adam=Stop complaining. Just shut up and eat.
M1030_S0500_S0110_201_eve=Okay... If you say so, Nii-chan, I'll eat it...
M1030_S0500_S0120_201_eve=But when I'm done, will you play with me?
M1030_S0500_S0130_201_adam=...Yeah.
M1030_S0500_S0140_201_eve=Then I'll try my best to eat it...!
