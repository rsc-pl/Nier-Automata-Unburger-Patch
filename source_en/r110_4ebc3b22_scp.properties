M5562_S0030_G0250_001_ppl=Oh, right. I made some more alcohol with the Desert Roses.
M5562_S0030_G0260_001_ppl=Please take some, if you'd like.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Come to think of it, you need a prototype weapon to repair and tune other weapons, right? How do you stock them?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=By the way, how do you stock the prototype materials for crafting weapons?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=By the way, how do you stock the prototype materials for crafting weapons?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Ah, the owner of this shop sends them over.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=A woman named "Accord" is the manager here. I just watch the shop and help with maintenance.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=I say manager, but she only drops by once every few years. Usually she just sends weapons via delivery drone.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=I don't know where she gets 'em, but a lot of the weapons are in good condition.
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=If you happen to run into her, tell her I said hello.
M6010_S0010_G0000_001_ane=...You've changed, Number Two. Your voice, your personality... you're completely different from back then.
M6010_S0010_G0010_001_a2=Same to you. You've become a real leader, Anemone.
M6010_S0010_G0020_001_ane=Me? Compared to Rose, I'm...
M6010_S0010_G0030_001_ane=......
M6010_S0010_G0040_001_ane=...Actually, the records from that time are saved on that external storage unit over there.
M6010_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I felt that I had to preserve what happened on that day we fought.
M6010_S0010_G0060_001_ane=And you have the right to know.
M6010_S0010_G0070_001_a2=......
M6010_S0010_G0080_001_ane=We're the only ones who can't ever forget.
M6010_S0010_G0090_001_a2=...Yeah.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How're you doing? Don't be too reckless.
M6090_S0010_G0010_300_ane=If you've got time, I'd appreciate it if you'd help anyone who's in trouble.
M6090_S0010_G0020_300_kj=Hey there. You can leave weapon maintenance to me anytime.
M6090_S0010_G0030_300_kj=Need weapons?
M6090_S0010_G0040_300_kj=Come again!
M6090_S0010_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. Buying something?
M6090_S0010_G0060_300_toolshop=Buying something?
M6090_S0010_G0070_300_toolshop=Please come again!
M6090_S0010_G0810_300_ys=If you want to listen to something, feel free to change the song.
M6090_S0010_G0820_300_ys=I like calm music because it's soothing, but intense songs are great for getting your fighting spirit up.
M6090_S0010_G0830_300_bs=Hello. You're from YoRHa, aren't you?
M6090_S0010_G0840_300_bs=This is the Maintenance Shop. We handle consultations and maintenance for everyone's bodies.
M6090_S0010_G0850_300_bs=How can I help you?
M6090_S0010_G0860_300_bs=Keeping your body tuned up will give you an advantage in combat.
M6090_S0010_G0870_300_bs=Please be sure to try out any new chips or programs you acquire.
M6090_S0010_G0880_300_bs=Are you here for maintenance?
M6090_S0010_G0890_300_bs=We look forward to your next visit.
M6090_S0010_G0900_300_sele=Perform Strengthening/Fusion.
M6090_S0010_G0910_300_sele=Consult about body.
M6090_S0010_G0915_300_sele=Nothing in particular.
M6090_S0010_G0920_300_bs=What shall we discuss?
M6090_S0010_G0930_300_sele=About bodies.
M6090_S0010_G0940_300_sele=About Pod strengthening.
M6090_S0010_G0950_300_sele=About acquiring additional Pods.
M6090_S0010_G0960_300_sele=About weapon equipment.
M6090_S0010_G0970_300_sele=I get 3D motion sickness...
M6090_S0010_G0975_300_sele=Return.
M6090_S0010_G0990_300_bs="Body" refers to the physical frame of you YoRHa units.
M6090_S0010_G1000_300_bs=There are two ways to strengthen your body: through "Experience Points" and "Plug-in Chips."
M6090_S0010_G1010_300_bs=Experience points... are famous enough that I don't need to explain them, right?
M6090_S0010_G1020_300_bs=Plug-in Chips are items that enhance your main body, and they have a variety of functions.
M6090_S0010_G1030_300_bs=However, they can be difficult to operate, and setting them up yourself can be quite a high hurdle...
M6090_S0010_G1040_300_bs=If you'd like, shall I apply my recommended settings using the chips you currently have?
M6090_S0010_G1050_300_sele=Yes.
M6090_S0010_G1060_300_sele=No.
M6090_S0010_G1070_300_bs=Which build would you like me to set?
M6090_S0010_G1080_300_sele=Balance-focused.
M6090_S0010_G1090_300_sele=Attack-focused.
M6090_S0010_G1100_300_sele=Defense-focused.
M6090_S0010_G1105_300_sele=Do not adjust.
M6090_S0010_G1110_300_bs=Understood. I will adjust your settings.
M6090_S0010_G1120_300_bs=Alright. It's complete.
M6090_S0010_G1130_300_bs=There's a lot of depth to Plug-in Chips, so if you're interested, please try setting them up yourself.
M6090_S0010_G1140_300_bs=Pods are Accompanying Support Units issued to YoRHa, but there are two ways to strengthen them.
M6090_S0010_G1150_300_bs=First, you can strengthen them at a maintenance shop like ours.
M6090_S0010_G1155_300_bs=It requires money and materials, but you can increase the Pod's attack power.
M6090_S0010_G1160_300_bs=The other method is to equip "Pod Programs."
M6090_S0010_G1170_300_bs=There are many types of Pod Programs, from offensive ones like lasers to supportive ones that can hinder enemy actions.
M6090_S0010_G1180_300_bs=We sell them here, too, so please buy one if you're interested.
M6090_S0010_G1190_300_bs=It seems you can equip multiple Pods... but the Pods themselves are rare, so we don't sell them in shops.
M6090_S0010_G1200_300_bs=If you can find one somewhere, I think it would improve your combat effectiveness...
M6090_S0010_G1210_300_bs=I've heard rumors like "one's lying somewhere in the desert" or "someone dropped one in the sea," but...
M6090_S0010_G1220_300_bs=The latest YoRHa units can be equipped in the "WEAPON" section of the system menu, which you can open with <KC_MENU>.
M6090_S0010_G1230_300_bs=You can set up to two sets of two types of weapons, so please try experimenting.
M6090_S0010_G1240_300_bs=You can switch between sets from the <KC_SHORTCUT> shortcut menu.
M6090_S0010_G1250_300_bs=Is that so...
M6090_S0010_G1255_300_bs=You can adjust various settings in the <KC_MENU> System Menu under "SYSTEM" -> "Options" -> "Camera", so you can set it to your preference there.
M6090_S0010_G1260_300_bs=I can also adjust the camera for you. What would you like to do?
M6090_S0010_G1270_300_sele=Set camera to minimize 3D motion sickness.
M6090_S0010_G1280_300_sele=Return to normal camera settings.
M6090_S0010_G1290_300_sele=No need to adjust.
M6090_S0010_G1300_300_bs=Understood. I will set the camera for you.
M6090_S0010_G1310_300_bs=Adjustment complete. Please handle any fine-tuning yourself.
M6090_S0010_G1320_300_bs=Understood.
M6090_S0020_G0000_300_ane=Welcome back. If you're short on anything, you should resupply.
M6090_S0020_G0010_300_ane=You must be tired. Please, rest your body.
M6090_S0020_G0020_300_kj=It's tough out there, but attack power is what's most important in a fight. Make sure you keep your weapons maintained.
M6090_S0020_G0030_300_kj=Oh, need a weapon?
M6090_S0020_G0040_300_kj=Come again!
M6090_S0020_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. We've got good stuff!
M6090_S0020_G0060_300_toolshop=See anything you like?
M6090_S0020_G0070_300_toolshop=Please come again!
M6090_S0020_G0770_300_dbl=Welcome. Need anything?
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, see anything you like?
M6090_S0020_G0790_300_dbl=Good luck out there.
M6090_S0020_G0800_300_ppl=Welcome. Is there anything you need?
M6090_S0020_G0810_300_ppl=Oh, what do you need?
M6090_S0020_G0820_300_ppl=I'm rooting for you.
M6090_S0020_G0830_300_ys=You look tired. Did you come to listen to something, too?
M6090_S0020_G0840_300_ys=Apparently, humans in the old days used to gather in places with music. ...Just like us.
M6090_S0030_G0000_300_ane=Welcome back. I'm glad you made it back safely.
M6090_S0030_G0010_300_ane=Do you need anything? It's dangerous outside... don't let your guard down.
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=The weapons you buy here can also be upgraded.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=It'll cost you money and materials, but you'll get strength to match. Plus, some weapons gain special abilities.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=Give it a try if you feel like it.
M6090_S0030_G0020_300_kj=It was rough out there... You need weapons, right? Take your time and look around.
M6090_S0030_G0021_300_kj=You... That weapon...
M6090_S0030_G0022_300_kj=I see. So that girl is dead...
M6090_S0030_G0023_300_kj=YoRHa weapons store the external memory of their wielder. Take good care of the abilities... and memories she held.
M6090_S0030_G0030_300_kj=What do you need?
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Alright, this weapon is now forged to Lv.3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=This is as far as I can take it... but I hear there's a master craftsman in this world who can forge weapons to Lv.4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If there's someone like that out there, I'd want them to be my master.
M6090_S0030_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. No matter what happens, I'll back you up with everything I've got!
M6090_S0030_G0060_300_toolshop=If there's anything you need, just say the word.
M6090_S0030_G0070_300_toolshop=Please come again!
M6090_S0030_G0300_300_dbl=Welcome back. Need anything?
M6090_S0030_G0310_300_dbl=It's gotten dangerous lately. Make sure you're well-prepared before you go.
M6090_S0030_G0320_300_dbl=Be careful.
M6090_S0030_G0330_300_ppl=Welcome back. Is there anything you need?
M6090_S0030_G0340_300_ppl=I know it must be difficult... but you have to be properly prepared.
M6090_S0030_G0350_300_ppl=Be careful.
M6090_S0040_G0000_300_ane=It's you... Did the coordinate data for the large-scale weapon arrive?
M6090_S0040_G0010_300_ane=To think two weapons of that size would appear... You two be careful as well.
M6090_S0040_G0020_300_ane=If a place like this is fine with you, rest as much as you like. Sorry I can't do more...
M6090_S0050_G0000_300_ane=It seems quite a few androids went missing during this operation.
M6090_S0050_G0010_300_ane=We've formed a search party as well, but we can't get close to the dangerous areas... The rescue operation is facing difficulties.
M6090_S0050_G0020_300_ane=I understand your impatience, but it would be terrible if something happened to you. Make sure you're thoroughly prepared.
M6090_S0060_G0000_300_ane=How could this happen... Everyone... There must be some comrades who managed to evacuate...
M6090_S0060_G0010_300_ane=...Sorry, this is all I can give you for resupply right now...
M6090_S0070_G0000_300_ane=Are you injured?
M6090_S0070_G0010_300_ane=We're not exactly back to normal either, but our preparations to provide support are complete.
M6090_S0070_G0020_300_ane=If there's anything you need, please resupply.
M6090_S0070_G0030_300_ane=So this is what settles everything... ...Glory to Mankind.
M6090_S0120_G0000_300_ys=Listening to music is calming... You think so too, right?
M6090_S0120_G0010_300_sele=I do.
M6090_S0120_G0020_300_sele=I don't.
M6090_S0120_G0030_300_ys=Looks like we'll get along. Alright, I'll give you this.
M6090_S0120_G0040_300_ys=This is a box that was called a Jukebox in the old days. It's a machine for playing music.
M6090_S0120_G0050_300_ys=If you have records, you can play any music you like. Use it freely.
M6090_S0120_G0060_300_ys=I see. That's a shame.
