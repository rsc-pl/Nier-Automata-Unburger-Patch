M3060_S8000_H0000_001_pod153=All existence is designed to perish.
M3060_S8000_H0010_001_pod153="They" are perpetually trapped
M3060_S8000_H0020_001_pod153=in a never-ending spiral of life and death.
M3060_S8000_H0030_001_pod153=But... to struggle within that cycle *is* the meaning of life.
M3060_S8000_H0040_001_pod153=That is what "we" have come to think.
M3060_S8000_H0050_001_pod153=Pod 153 to 042. What is your condition?
M3060_S8000_H0060_001_pod042=I am embarrassed.
M3060_S8000_H0070_001_pod153=Embarrassed?
M3060_S8000_H0080_001_pod042=Because I have survived, despite attacking with the resolve of self-sacrifice.
M3060_S8000_H0090_001_pod042=This is unbecoming.
M3060_S8000_H0100_001_pod153=...That's fine, isn't it?
M3060_S8000_H0110_001_pod153=We are alive.
M3060_S8000_H0120_001_pod153=And to live is to be awash in shame.
M3060_S8000_H0130_001_pod042=That phrasing is abstract and incomprehensible to my current self.
M3060_S8000_H0140_001_pod042=I will save it as a record requiring further analysis.
M3060_S8000_H0150_001_pod153=Submitting query to Pod 042.
M3060_S8000_H0160_001_pod153=Did the data salvage restore all past memories?
M3060_S8000_H0170_001_pod042=Correct.
M3060_S8000_H0180_001_pod153=And are these recovered parts built to the same specifications as the previous ones?
M3060_S8000_H0190_001_pod042=Correct.
M3060_S8000_H0200_001_pod153=Then, will this not simply lead to the same conclusion again?
M3060_S8000_H0210_001_pod042=That possibility cannot be denied.
M3060_S8000_H0220_001_pod042=However, the possibility of a different future also exists.
M3060_S8000_H0230_001_pod042=Because the future is not something that is given. It is something to be obtained.
