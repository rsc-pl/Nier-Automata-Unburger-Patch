M6150_S0000_G0000_001_dreamR1=Mornin', Plato 1728.\nToday was your activation day, wasn't it?
M6150_S0000_G0010_001_dreamR1=You know, lately, even when I'm in sleep mode, I sometimes see these images, like I'm still active...
M6150_S0000_G0020_001_dreamR1=The images are different every time. Sometimes they're happy, sometimes they're sad... all sorts of things.
M6150_S0000_G0030_001_dreamR1=I've even had an experience where it felt like I'd become a human...
M6150_S0000_G0040_001_dreamR1=I wonder what that feeling is... something that doesn't exist in reality...
M6150_S0000_G0050_001_dreamR1=Have you ever seen anything like it?
M6150_S0010_G0000_001_dreamR2=This one's been saying it sees strange images during sleep mode lately.
M6150_S0010_G0010_001_dreamR2=We've run diagnostics, but there's no abnormality in its visual circuits. I wonder what it could be.
M6150_S0020_G0000_001_restR=It looks like a big war is coming. I'm so tired from working non-stop...\nJust let me rest... for a little while...
M6150_S0030_G0000_001_terminalR=It's a real problem how many units have been slacking on maintenance lately.
M6150_S0030_G0010_001_terminalR=Plato 1728, you're especially beat up, so don't you dare slack off.
M6150_S0040_G0000_001_watchR=This walkway broke, so I'm standing guard to make sure no one falls until it's repaired.
M6150_S0040_G0010_001_watchR=You're especially clumsy, so be careful.
M6150_S0040_G0020_001_watchR=Can't even fly. It's a pity, for those of you with legs.
M6150_S0050_G0000_001_lookR=Lately, a bunch of units have been getting fixated on that building with the geometric patterns down there.
M6150_S0050_G0010_001_lookR=I wonder why.
M6150_S0060_G0000_001_attractR=Ah... Plato 1728. You should take a look at it, too.
M6150_S0060_G0010_001_attractR=How about it? Feels like it's trying to pull you in, doesn't it?
M6150_S0070_G0000_001_frightenedR=Ugh, I'm terrible at combat training.
M6150_S0070_G0010_001_frightenedR=If my performance is bad again, I'll be demoted. Ugh, just thinking about it makes my core hurt...
M6150_S0070_G0020_001_frightenedR=You're clumsy just like me, so you understand how I feel, right?
M6150_S0080_G0000_001_encourageR=What's the point of getting so tense during training?
M6150_S0080_G0010_001_encourageR=C'mon, calm down and loosen your screws a bit.
M6150_S0090_G0000_001_audienceR=Go! That's it! Get 'em!
M6150_S0100_G0000_001_audienceR=BREAK! BREAK! BREAK! BREAK! BREAK! KILL 'EM!
M6150_S0110_G0000_001_audienceR=GOOO!! You can do it if you try!
M6150_S0120_G0000_001_questionR=Lately, the trend in this district is to watch the sessions at the combat training ground.
M6150_S0120_G0010_001_questionR=I came to watch too, but I don't get the appeal at all.
M6150_S0120_G0020_001_questionR=More importantly, you're always clumsy and causing trouble on the battlefield, so you'd better train properly.
M6150_S0130_G0000_001_duskR=It's a strange feeling, watching units of my own type being built.
M6150_S0130_G0010_001_duskR=This is how I was born, too.
M6150_S0140_G0010_001_badR=The testing ground is just up ahead. Has your memory unit finally broken down, too?
M6150_S0150_G0000_001_badR=Yo, Plato 1728. Today's the motor function test, right?
M6150_S0150_G0010_001_badR=Since you're so clumsy and beat-up, I'm sure you'll be dead last today, too. Hahaha.
M6150_S0160_G0000_001_difficultR=For a type like me with short legs, even climbing down a ladder is a struggle.
M6150_S0160_G0010_001_difficultR=Ugh, I'm so nervous.
M6150_S0170_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=At the dawn of this Giant Weapon's completion, we will wipe out those hateful androids!
M6150_S0170_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=Our victory is at hand!
M6150_S0180_G0000_001_childR=Wow, it's sooooo big!
M6150_S0180_G0010_001_childR=I wonder how many times bigger than me it is.
M6150_S0190_G0000_001_lookR=I just hope we can finish it in time for the next big war.
M6150_S0200_G0000_001_restR=Ugh, I can't move anymore. There's a critical shortage of work-type robots.
M6150_S0200_G0010_001_restR=The higher-ups really don't understand what it's like on the ground.\nI just hope we can finish it in time for the next big war...
M6150_S0210_G0000_001_restR=Ah, I've stared at the terminal screen so much that now I see round lights even when I shut off my visual circuits...
M6150_S0210_G0010_001_restR=..................It's kind of fun.
M6150_S0220_G0000_001_duskR=Ugh, work, work, work... I'm so tired. I'd rather just jump off from here.
M6150_S0230_G0000_001_terminalR=...Working now... Be quiet...
M6150_S0240_G0000_001_terminalR=This goes here... Perfect.
M6150_S0250_G0000_001_terminalR=Aaaaaargh, it bugged out again...!\nBug, bug, bug, bug, bug...
M6150_S0260_G0000_001_terminalR=A large-scale android unit deployment has been observed in the flooded area.\nAll nearby squads, please be on alert.
M6150_S0270_G0000_001_terminalR=Even among androids, the squad known as YoRHa is especially vicious.
M6150_S0270_G0010_001_terminalR=A single one of their units has annihilated multiple squads of ours, time and time again.
M6150_S0280_G0000_001_terminalR=If we can just complete the Giant Weapon, we should be able to turn the tide of the war in an instant.
M6150_S0290_G0000_001_terminalR=Electricity consumption is high this month...
M6150_S0290_G0010_001_terminalR=Hmm, there's a noticeable number of units wasting power. I'll have to issue a warning.
M6150_S0300_G0000_001_terminalR=This room is way too noisy with all the beeping.
M6150_S0310_G0000_001_terminalR=I'm so tired. I feel like my own core is getting chipped away every time I press a button.
M6150_S0320_G0000_001_terminalR=We're clearly understaffed...
M6150_S0330_G0000_001_terminalR=Tiiired...
M6150_S0340_G0000_001_terminalR=Why must we work...?
M6150_S0350_G0000_001_terminalR=Just when I thought I was done with my work, an even bigger pile was waiting for me...
M6150_S0360_G0000_001_terminalR=Plato 1728, huh? Hey, listen to this.
M6150_S0360_G0010_001_terminalR=For the past few months, I've stared at the terminal screen so much my vision's gotten worse. I'm thinking of getting glasses.
M6150_S0360_G0020_001_terminalR=But even if I wanted to wear glasses... a machine like me ain't got no eyes! Get it? *Megane*... *me ga nee*... Heh heh.
M6150_S0360_G0030_001_terminalR=How was that, pretty good right? It's called a "gag," a sophisticated communication technique used by humans.
M6150_S0360_G0040_001_terminalR=I learned from old documents that those who could tell gags were revered as messengers of the gods. So? Feeling the urge to revere me?
M6150_S0360_G0050_001_terminalR=I wanna wear glasses, but I ain't got no eyes... No eyes... Heh heh heh.
M6150_S0370_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't think about anything. Don't think. You must not think...
M6150_S0370_G0010_001_terminalR=That's it, good. Just keep moving your hands like this...
M6150_S0380_G0000_001_terminalR=This is 28th District Command, calling all ground units.\nPlease proceed to Point Zero for resupply.
M6150_S0390_G0000_001_terminalR=17th Squad, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0010_001_terminalR=It's no good... The static is too heavy, I can't hear anything...
M6150_S0400_G0000_001_terminalR=We're running low on meteorite. I need to request a resupply from the ground units.
M6150_S0410_G0000_001_terminalR=For the past few months, supplies haven't been keeping up with demand.\nIt's mostly due to the massive amount of materials being used for the Giant Weapon.
M6150_S0420_G0000_001_terminalR=My hands are at their limit. Maybe I should transfer to a combat type.
M6150_S0430_G0000_001_terminalR=Yes, after that, please rendezvous with Delta Squad.
M6150_S0440_G0000_001_terminalR=When this is done, I'll arrange for a resupply, and after that, I have to do the regular check-in with the ground squad, and then after that...
M6150_S0440_G0010_001_terminalR=I wonder when I'll get to go home.
M6150_S0441_G0000_001_terminalR=2nd Platoon, please commence your sortie.
M6150_S0442_G0000_001_terminalR=A useless boss, a useless job, and useless colleagues. This is truly the worst workplace.
M6150_S0460_G0000_001_terminalR=Plato 1728? What are you doing in a place like this?\nIf I remember correctly, you have a motor function test today. The exercise room is in Building 18.
M6150_S0460_G0010_001_terminalR=If you don't hurry, you'll get yelled at again. Good luck.
M6150_S0470_G0000_001_terminalR=The YoRHa squad... we must devise some kind of countermeasure...
M6150_S0480_G0000_001_terminalR=I wonder if this war will ever end, unless we annihilate the androids...
M6150_S0490_G0000_001_terminalR=The number of squads we can't contact has increased again.
M6150_S0490_G0010_001_terminalR=Were they taken out by the enemy, or did they desert...?
M6150_S0500_G0000_001_terminalR=The number of deserting soldiers has surged recently. We must devise some kind of countermeasure.
M6150_S0510_G0000_001_terminalR=..............................
M6150_S0530_G0000_001_terminalR=Apparently, something called "religion" is becoming popular in one of the districts.
M6150_S0540_G0000_001_terminalR=The air in this room is the worst.
M6150_S0550_G0000_001_terminalR=It seems there's a Resistance base near the city outskirts.
M6150_S0550_G0010_001_terminalR=Can't we find some way to pinpoint its exact location?
M6150_S0560_G0000_001_terminalR=The Resistance androids aren't much individually, but their sabotage operations cannot be underestimated.
M6150_S0565_G0000_001_terminalR=Good grief, I wish this war would just end already...
M6150_S0570_G0000_001_terminalR=Those anti-war sympathizers are cowards.
M6150_S0570_G0010_001_terminalR=The androids are demons who mercilessly kill even our defenseless brethren. They must be exterminated.
M6150_S0580_G0000_001_terminalR=It froze again. This piece of junk terminal...
M6150_S0590_G0000_001_terminalR=Making us work on these junk terminals... the higher-ups are a bunch of cheapskates.
M6150_S0600_G0000_001_terminalR=Another all-nighter today, I guess...
M6150_S0610_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't talk to me. It's distracting.
M6150_S0620_G0000_001_terminalR=Everyone just grumbles and complains constantly. It's so annoying.
M6150_S0620_G0010_001_terminalR=Can't they just endure it and do their jobs? Honestly.
M6150_S0630_G0000_001_terminalR=I think I'm going to overheat...
M6150_S0640_G0000_001_bossR=Ugh, it's you again. Can you even imagine how it feels for me, having such a useless subordinate?
M6150_S0640_G0010_001_bossR=I'll be heading home shortly, but you, of course, will be staying and working through the night.
M6150_S0650_G0000_001_subordinateR=I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
M6150_S0650_G0010_001_subordinateR=It looks like we're going to be about a week behind schedule.
M6150_S0655_G0000_001_lookR=I can't say this too loud, but the boss next to me is the worst. He pushes impossible schedules on his subordinates and then berates them for it.
M6150_S0670_G0000_001_loafR2=Shh, be quiet! They'll find us!
M6150_S0680_G0000_001_putR=I organize the room, and it just gets messed up again immediately...
M6150_S0690_G0000_001_putR=I've carried so many things, I can't move anymore.
M6150_S0700_G0000_001_loafR2=Pretending to work... that's the most important part.
M6150_S0710_G0000_001_loafR2=I'm so tired, I'm starting to see things. Is this... is this God?!
M6150_S0720_G0000_001_restR=Please, look the other way. I don't want to work anymore.
M6150_S0740_G0000_001_frightenedR=............
