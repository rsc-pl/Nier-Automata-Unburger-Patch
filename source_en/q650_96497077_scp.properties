M5650_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah... I'm in trouble...
M5650_S0010_G0010_001_sele=I don't know what's wrong, but I'll listen.
M5650_S0010_G0020_001_sele=This seems like a hassle. I'll do it later.
M5650_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=Ugh... This is bad. What should I do...
M5650_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=If you don't mind, could you tell me what you're troubled about?
M5650_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=I might be able to help.
M5650_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=Ah... you're from the Bunker.
M5650_S0010_G0070_001_resiman=Actually, I have to prepare some "Cargo for Transport," but I can't get it out.
M5650_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=My senpai was originally in charge of it, but there's too much cargo for me to move.
M5650_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=What a mess... At this rate, my senpai's going to get mad at me...
M5650_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=I have to go get the "Cargo for Transport" that was left in the warehouse back there, but...
M5650_S0020_G0000_300_resiman=You'll go get it for me?
M5650_S0020_G0010_001_pod153=Marking objects believed to be "Cargo for Transport."
M5650_S0020_G0010_300_sele=Guess I have no choice.
M5650_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=...Even so, there's no way to carry it out like this.
M5650_S0020_G0020_300_sele=I'm busy right now.
M5650_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=*Sigh*... I guess I have to clear a path first.
M5650_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=I'm counting on you!
M5650_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=With that, all the "Cargo for Transport" has been gathered.
M5650_S0020_G0040_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside for a change of pace.
M5650_S0020_G0050_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside for a change of pace.
M5650_S0020_G0051_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside and deliver the cargo to the client.
M5650_S0020_G0052_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside and deliver the cargo to the client.
M5650_S0020_G0060_300_sele=Go outside.
M5650_S0020_G0070_300_sele=Continue working.
M5650_S0020_G0080_300_resiman=Sorry you came all this way, but I think it's better to focus on your mission right now.
M5650_S0020_G0090_300_resiman=Please come back when things have calmed down.
M5650_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=Whoa! You brought the cargo! You're a lifesaver, thank you!
M5650_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=You leave your cargo all over the place. I could barely walk in there, you know?
M5650_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Why don't you try organizing it a little?
M5650_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=Ugh... My apologies. I'll tell my senpai...
M5650_S0030_G0040_001_resiman=Here, it's not much, but take it as my thanks.
M5650_S0030_G0050_001_resiman=Seriously... managing materials isn't easy...
M5651_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Marking objects believed to be "Cargo for Transport."
