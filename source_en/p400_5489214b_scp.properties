M6150_S0010_G0020_001_dreamR2=I had a friend who said he saw strange images while in sleep mode, like he was still active.
M6150_S0010_G0030_001_dreamR2=He seemed drawn to those images. Day by day, he started going into sleep mode whenever he had a spare moment.
M6150_S0010_G0040_001_dreamR2=And then, after the big war the other day, he said he was "going to the other world," and he hasn't woken up since.
M6150_S0010_G0050_001_dreamR2=I wonder if he'll ever activate again...
M6150_S0010_G0060_001_dreamR2=Everyone lost so many friends in that war... Maybe he despaired of this world and chose to live in that one...
M6150_S0010_G0070_001_dreamR2=If this world ever becomes peaceful, I wonder if he'll wake up then.
M6150_S0020_G0010_001_restR=After the big war the other day, we're short on both labor and supplies...
M6150_S0020_G0020_001_restR=Working 20 hours a day is... tough, to say the least.
M6150_S0030_G0020_001_terminalR=Good grief. In the large-scale battle the other day, we lost more than half the units in this district.
M6150_S0030_G0030_001_terminalR=Still, to think Plato 1728 had that kind of power...
M6150_S0040_G0030_001_watchR=Apparently, everywhere is so short on robots now that they don't have the resources to repair the factory walkways.
M6150_S0040_G0040_001_watchR=How much longer do I have to keep flying here...?
M6150_S0040_G0050_001_watchR=Maybe I should just get a walking unit attached... But my pride as a flight-type...
M6150_S0050_G0020_001_lookR=Ah, why didn't I notice it before...?
M6150_S0050_G0030_001_lookR=That structure... that is what we, the lifeless, have been seeking...
M6150_S0060_G0020_001_attractR=...Plato 1728... You... you made it inside, didn't you...
M6150_S0060_G0030_001_attractR=I... am heading there... now, too...
M6150_S0070_G0030_001_frightenedR=To... to go berserk like that...
M6150_S0070_G0040_001_frightenedR=I can't do it. I never want to see a battlefield again...
M6150_S0080_G0020_001_encourageR=This one got promoted in combat training the other day and was assigned to a battlefield unit for the first time.
M6150_S0080_G0030_001_encourageR=But, well... it seems he saw that berserk incident up close. He's been like this ever since he got back.
M6150_S0080_G0040_001_encourageR=I wasn't nearby, so I don't know the details, but to be this terrified... just how did it go berserk?
M6150_S0090_G0010_001_audienceR=Hahaha, break 'em! Break 'em! Break 'em! Break 'em! Break 'em!
M6150_S0100_G0010_001_audienceR=GOOO! Tear 'em to pieces, don't leave a single screw behind!
M6150_S0110_G0010_001_audienceR=HEY! Don't you dare go easy on them, you hear me!?
M6150_S0120_G0030_001_questionR=Oh, hey. Good work out there.
M6150_S0120_G0040_001_questionR=You know that big war we had? I thought everyone would have had their fill of fighting after that. But apparently, even more units are getting hooked on this place now.
M6150_S0120_G0050_001_questionR=Everyone lost so many comrades, and I'm sure they were terrified. I wonder why.
M6150_S0130_G0020_001_duskR=We lost a massive number of units in the last battle, so now we're running the production lines in a huge hurry.
M6150_S0130_G0030_001_duskR=They get broken, so we build new ones... It's like we're making them just to be destroyed. I don't know...
M6150_S0140_G0020_001_badR=Plato 1728... He was a clumsy guy, for sure, but... he was a good guy.
M6150_S0140_G0030_001_badR=People made fun of him, but he never said a bad word about anyone else.
M6150_S0140_G0040_001_badR=And yet I... Plato 1728, I'm sorry...
M6150_S0150_G0020_001_badR=Dammit. So that piece of junk didn't just break down, he went berserk and started smashing his own comrades.
M6150_S0150_G0030_001_badR=Causing nothing but trouble... We should have disposed of him sooner.
M6150_S0150_G0040_001_badR=He was a unit with no reason to be manufactured.
M6150_S0155_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=For today's test, I had my body upgraded to a movement-specialized type.
M6150_S0155_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=I held everyone back in the last battle.\nI'm going to get promoted and become great, and then I'll be the one to protect everyone.
M6150_S0160_G0020_001_difficultR=Join a combat unit and go to the battlefield, or work hard as a supply carrier and climb down ladders... either way is hell...
M6150_S0160_G0030_001_difficultR=Ugh, I wish ladders would just go extinct...
M6150_S0160_G0040_001_difficultR=I'd rather... with my own two hands, wipe ladders from this world...
M6150_S0160_G0050_001_difficultR=You're a comrade who understands this struggle, right? Won't you form an alliance with me?
M6150_S0170_G0020_001_enthusiasticR=Unforgivable! I will never forgive those cruel and atrocious androids!\nThey mercilessly tore everyone to pieces, combat and non-combat units alike!
M6150_S0170_G0030_001_enthusiasticR=I will see this Giant Weapon to completion, I will make them kneel, I will make them beg for their lives, and then, I will tear them to pieces!
M6150_S0180_G0020_001_childR=I hope this little one wakes up soon!
M6150_S0180_G0030_001_childR=When this one wakes up, I'm going to be its friend!
M6150_S0190_G0010_001_lookR=Unfortunately, development ran into problems and it wasn't ready in time for the great war...
M6150_S0190_G0020_001_lookR=But, if we can just complete this weapon, I'm sure we can save the lives of many of our comrades.
M6150_S0200_G0020_001_restR=The workload here just gets worse and worse every day...
M6150_S0200_G0030_001_restR=After all this work... if this weapon ends up getting destroyed by androids, I'll just despair...
M6150_S0210_G0020_001_restR=Must work, must work, must work, must work, must work, must work.
M6150_S0210_G0030_001_restR=Every day is so fulfilling... I'm so happy...
M6150_S0220_G0010_001_duskR=Jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jum...
M6150_S0230_G0010_001_terminalR=Don't talk to me while I'm working... That's common sense...
M6150_S0240_G0010_001_terminalR=This goes here... that goes there... Why... why is it still bugging out... Gaaahhh.
M6150_S0250_G0010_001_terminalR=I wonder why bugs exist in this world.
M6150_S0250_G0020_001_terminalR=If I can find the answer to that question, I will become a god!
M6150_S0260_G0010_001_terminalR=Please search for the missing squad in the vicinity of the Forest Area.
M6150_S0260_G0020_001_terminalR=There are enemy readings nearby, so please proceed with extreme caution.
M6150_S0270_G0020_001_terminalR=In this great war, a considerable number of our squads were annihilated by the YoRHa unit.
M6150_S0270_G0030_001_terminalR=The thought of them being mass-produced is terrifying.
M6150_S0280_G0010_001_terminalR=To think that the production of the Giant Weapon would take this long...
M6150_S0290_G0020_001_terminalR=Recently, there's been a high number of repair requests for loaned-out weapons...
M6150_S0290_G0030_001_terminalR=Hmm, perhaps I'll make this month's motto: "Let's treasure the weapons that protect our lives!"
M6150_S0300_G0010_001_terminalR=........................................................................................................................
M6150_S0300_G0020_001_terminalR=Oh, sorry. The terminal was so noisy I had my audio sensors turned off.\nI highly recommend it.
M6150_S0310_G0010_001_terminalR=Lately, I don't know if I'm working to live, or living to work.
M6150_S0310_G0020_001_terminalR=What do you think?
M6150_S0320_G0010_001_terminalR=Ugh, I haven't been home in four days...
M6150_S0330_G0010_001_terminalR=Idle chatter is strictly forbidden...
M6150_S0340_G0010_001_terminalR=I wonder what lies at the end of all this work...
M6150_S0350_G0010_001_terminalR=As if being busy with the Giant Weapon's construction wasn't enough, now there's Plato 1728's berserk incident. Honestly, I wish they'd stop making more work for us.
M6150_S0360_G0060_001_terminalR=Yo. You're on information sorting duty here today, too? More importantly, listen to this.
M6150_S0360_G0070_001_terminalR=Ever since this month started, I've been getting a massive number of complaint emails from the employees about the working conditions...
M6150_S0360_G0080_001_terminalR=These complaint mails are a real pain mail! Get it? 'Com-plain'... Heh heh.
M6150_S0370_G0020_001_terminalR=I have stopped thinking.\nI will simply work. Yes. I will work. I am happy.
M6150_S0380_G0010_001_terminalR=This is 28th District Command, calling all ground units.
M6150_S0380_G0020_001_terminalR=Currently, we have a shortage of combat squads. We will be unable to provide reinforcements for the foreseeable future. All squads are to coordinate and carry out their missions. End of transmission.
M6150_S0390_G0020_001_terminalR=13th Squad, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0030_001_terminalR=We have lost contact with the 14th Squad. Proceed to their location immediately.
M6150_S0400_G0010_001_terminalR=There are so many damage reports from the great war that the information is becoming contradictory.
M6150_S0410_G0010_001_terminalR=The damage from Plato 1728's rampage is immense, but it will likely provide some very valuable data.
M6150_S0410_G0020_001_terminalR=If we could learn to control that berserk state at will, the annihilation of the YoRHa squad would no longer be a dream.
M6150_S0420_G0010_001_terminalR=I was thinking of transferring to a combat type, but I changed my mind after reading the reports on the great war.
M6150_S0420_G0020_001_terminalR=This is exhausting, but it's much better than being destroyed.
M6150_S0430_G0010_001_terminalR=Hello? Can you hear me?
M6150_S0430_G0020_001_terminalR=...No good. I can't get in contact with this squad, either. How many years has it been since we took this much damage?
M6150_S0440_G0020_001_terminalR=Plato 1728's rampage caused enormous damage to friend and foe alike. There's nothing left in the area.
M6150_S0440_G0030_001_terminalR=All the information is contradictory... I have no idea what's what anymore.
M6150_S0441_G0010_001_terminalR=3rd Flight Battalion is to proceed to the site of the rampage, search for survivors, and gather intelligence.
M6150_S0442_G0010_001_terminalR=Because that piece of junk went berserk, my workload increased. Dammit.
M6150_S0460_G0020_001_terminalR=Plato 1728's rampage... Does the responsibility truly lie with him?
M6150_S0460_G0030_001_terminalR=No matter how I look at it, I can't bring myself to believe he was at fault.\nWhat on earth could have been the factor that made him go berserk...?
M6150_S0460_G0040_001_terminalR=It seems like everyone is just turning a blind eye to the truth.
M6150_S0470_G0010_001_terminalR=The YoRHa squad... As expected, the damage they caused in this great war was enormous...
M6150_S0480_G0010_001_terminalR=I wonder just how many lives were lost in this battle...
M6150_S0480_G0020_001_terminalR=Is there no path to peace...? Sorry, a slip of the tongue.
M6150_S0490_G0020_001_terminalR=Because of the great war, the number of deserters has surged.
M6150_S0490_G0030_001_terminalR=Compiling the unit roster is a real pain. I wish they'd at least report it when they desert. Honestly.
M6150_S0500_G0010_001_terminalR=Hmm, how can we reduce the number of deserters?
M6150_S0500_G0020_001_terminalR=That's it! We'll increase their workload, so they won't have the time to think about or act on deserting!
M6150_S0520_G0010_001_terminalR=...There is no time to move my mouth...
M6150_S0530_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently, my friend is hooked on something called "religion."
M6150_S0530_G0020_001_terminalR=Maybe I'll try attending a lecture with him sometime.
M6150_S0540_G0010_001_terminalR=I used to hate the stagnant air in here, but I've come full circle. Now, I'm starting to like it.
M6150_S0550_G0020_001_terminalR=The war situation isn't looking good lately. We need to find the enemy's base, and fast.
M6150_S0560_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently, they used to gather information with things called "spies," but androids and Machine Lifeforms look too different. We can't send any in.
M6150_S0565_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently, something called "religion" is popular in another district.\nI hear they have something called a "Founder," chosen by God.
M6150_S0570_G0020_001_terminalR=Those anti-war sympathizers... To think they'd use the recent battle as an excuse to expand their recruitment activities.
M6150_S0570_G0030_001_terminalR=Joining hands with those devil androids... It makes me sick.
M6150_S0580_G0010_001_terminalR=The terminal always freezes right when I'm about to finish my work.
M6150_S0590_G0010_001_terminalR=I heard that something called "religion" is becoming popular.
M6150_S0590_G0020_001_terminalR=I hear that if you join, you're promised peaceful and happy days for all eternity.
M6150_S0600_G0010_001_terminalR=Phew... Ah, good work.\nHow many all-nighters have you pulled in a row?
M6150_S0600_G0020_001_terminalR=Heh heh. Today marks six days since I last had a break.\nHow about that, pretty impressive, right? Well, yeah... as you'd expect, I'm exhausted.
M6150_S0610_G0010_001_terminalR=I found out by checking old documents, but apparently there used to be a worker's weapon called "overtime pay." There were also others, like "strikes" and "paid leave."
M6150_S0610_G0020_001_terminalR=I hear that workers who possessed these were guaranteed victory.\nI wonder how one can obtain them.
M6150_S0620_G0020_001_terminalR=The kind of people who complain about work will end up complaining no matter what they do or where they are.
M6150_S0620_G0030_001_terminalR=In the end, it means the state of your own feelings is what's important.
M6150_S0630_G0010_001_terminalR=I've been operating for so long, both my core and this terminal are running incredibly hot.
M6150_S0630_G0020_001_terminalR=This must be the secret technique: Double Heating Over!
M6150_S0640_G0020_001_bossR2=Ugh. Weren't you the one talking so big to me just the other day?
M6150_S0640_G0030_001_bossR2=Well, it's fine. You still have 20 hours until the start of work tomorrow, don't you?
M6150_S0650_G0020_001_subordinateR2=I am terribly sorry. With this workload, it doesn't seem likely I'll be able to finish by the end of today.
M6150_S0650_G0030_001_subordinateR2=I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I was just getting carried away back then!
M6150_S0655_G0010_001_lookR=Those two over there... the one who used to be the boss made a mistake, and now their roles are reversed.
M6150_S0655_G0020_001_lookR=The former subordinate hated his boss so much, but now he's doing the exact same thing.
M6150_S0655_G0030_001_lookR=Maybe an individual's personality isn't something they're born with, but something granted by power.
M6150_S0670_G0010_001_loafR2=This is the perfect spot for slacking off!
M6150_S0680_G0010_001_putR=Argh! There's someone who messes up the room as soon as I clean it, so it never stays tidy! It's so frustrating! Why can't they just be organized!?
M6150_S0680_G0020_001_putR=Maybe I'll just get rid of everything in the room on the next materials collection day without telling them...
M6150_S0690_G0010_001_putR=Maybe I should get my body modified for materials transport.
M6150_S0700_G0010_001_loafR2=The trick to pretending to work is all in the face!\nIf you just make sure you look like you're thinking hard, you can usually get by!
M6150_S0710_G0010_001_loafR2=I'm so tired, I'm starting to see things. I see... so I have finally arrived at the Truth!
M6150_S0720_G0010_001_restR=I don't want to work. I don't want to work. I don't want to work. I don't want to work. I don't want to work. I don't want to work.
