M5500_S0010_G0000_001_andwoman=...!
M5500_S0010_G0010_001_andman=Damn! We're in trouble...!
M5500_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=H-Hey.
M5500_S0010_G0030_001_andwoman=Please, let us go!
M5500_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Um... aren't you misunderstanding something?
M5500_S0010_G0050_001_andman=...You didn't come to capture us?
M5500_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=No!
M5500_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=What exactly happened?
M5500_S0010_G0080_001_andwoman=...We deserted. From the Resistance Camp.
M5500_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=Deserted!?
M5500_S0010_G0100_001_andman=We're sick of fighting! We just want to live quietly, the two of us!
M5500_S0010_G0110_001_andwoman=Hey, please. Keep it a secret that we're here?
M5500_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=We are YoRHa troops. An organization different from the Resistance.
M5500_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=We have no obligation to report you.
M5500_S0010_G0140_001_andwoman=Thank goodness...
M5500_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=But, if you stay in a place like this, you'll be found eventually, you know...?
M5500_S0010_G0160_001_andman=We know. But my body isn't moving well. We don't have maintenance parts...
M5500_S0010_G0170_001_andwoman=Um, I know it's incredibly brazen, but could you bring us the materials needed for maintenance?
M5500_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=Eh? Us?
M5500_S0010_G0190_001_andwoman=We can't move around.
M5500_S0010_G0200_001_andwoman=We'll pay you well... please!
M5500_S0010_G0210_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5500_S0010_G0220_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5500_S0010_G0230_001_andwoman=Ah, that helps. We need an "Elaborate Machine" for maintenance.
M5500_S0010_G0240_001_andwoman=I saw one near the Abandoned Factory before.
M5500_S0010_G0250_001_andman=I believe in you. I'm counting on you.
M5500_S0010_G0260_001_andman=Surely the Resistance pursuers will come here too. Even though we just want to live quietly together...
M5500_S0010_G0270_001_andwoman=Could you bring the materials needed for maintenance? If you do, we'll leave this place... please!
M5500_S0020_G0000_001_andwoman=Ah, this is it! With this, we can do maintenance!
M5500_S0020_G0010_001_andman=Thank you. I'm glad we trusted you.
M5500_S0020_G0020_001_andman=When maintenance is finished, we'll leave here. Please pray for our safety.
M5500_S0020_G0030_001_n02=The Androids who were here have left, haven't they.
M5500_S0020_G0035_001_n02=I want to go beyond the sea too...
M5500_S0020_G0040_001_n02=I hope they are safe somewhere... I wish for the happiness of those two.
M5500_S0020_G0050_001_andman=Do you remember us? You helped us...
M5500_S0020_G0060_001_andman=You saved us back then. Thank you.
M5500_S0020_G0070_001_andwoman=...Actually, I have a request, is that okay?
M5500_S0020_G0080_001_andman=Idiot, stop it! Don't involve them any further!
M5500_S0020_G0090_001_andwoman=But...
M5500_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Is something wrong? You want materials for repair again?
M5500_S0020_G0110_001_andman=No, well...
M5500_S0020_G0120_001_andwoman=It's no use having weird pride, right? It's a fact that we're in trouble.
M5500_S0020_G0130_001_andman=However...
M5500_S0020_G0140_001_andwoman=Ah, geez, you're always like that. Just be quiet.
M5500_S0020_G0150_001_andwoman=Listen, we are thinking of escaping to another area beyond the sea.
M5500_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Is that so... But, how?
M5500_S0020_G0170_001_andwoman=There is an underground Resistance member who lets people escape. They are called the "Escape Artist."
M5500_S0020_G0180_001_andwoman=But, a considerable amount of money is needed...
M5500_S0020_G0190_001_andwoman=Specifically, we want about 50,000 G. If you have it, could you donate it?
M5500_S0020_G0200_001_sele=Give 50,000 G.
M5500_S0020_G0210_001_sele=Do not give.
M5500_S0020_G0220_001_andwoman=R-Really!? Thank you!
M5500_S0020_G0230_001_andman=I'm sorry. Just because I'm unreliable...
M5500_S0020_G0240_001_andman=Someday, I will surely repay you. I swear.
M5500_S0020_G0250_001_andwoman=We need about 50,000 G to escape beyond the sea. If you have it, could you donate it?
M5500_S0020_G0251_001_andwoman=Oh, it seems you don't have enough on hand now.
M5500_S0020_G0252_001_andwoman=When you have it ready, will you come again?
M5500_S0020_G0260_001_andman=U... ah...
M5500_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=Are you okay!? What on earth happened here!?
M5500_S0020_G0280_001_andman=T-The Escape Artist suddenly attacked us...!
M5500_S0020_G0290_001_andman=He intended to deceive us from the start.
M5500_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=What happened to the other one!?
M5500_S0020_G0310_001_andman=Sh-She became a decoy to protect me and moved away from here...
M5500_S0020_G0320_001_andman=Please, won't you help me find her!?
M5500_S0020_G0330_001_sele=Help.
M5500_S0020_G0340_001_sele=Do not help.
M5500_S0020_G0350_001_andman=Thank you... I'll give you her biological code. Please, I beg you!
M5500_S0020_G0370_001_a2b=Pod. Search position information for the android with this biological code.
M5500_S0020_G0380_001_pod042=Details unknown. However, information regarding the last sighted point exists.
M5500_S0020_G0390_001_pod042=As a result of comprehensive analysis, the android's current position is predicted to be the Amusement Park Ruins area.
M5500_S0020_G0400_001_a2b=Understood.
M5500_S0020_G0410_001_a9s=Pod. Search position information for the android with this biological code.
M5500_S0020_G0420_001_pod153=Details unknown. However, information regarding the last sighted point exists.
M5500_S0020_G0430_001_pod153=As a result of comprehensive analysis, the android's current position is predicted to be the Amusement Park Ruins area.
M5500_S0020_G0440_001_a9s=Understood.
M5500_S0060_G0000_001_andwoman=Ugh...
M5500_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=Are you okay!?
M5500_S0060_G0020_001_andwoman=Ugh, uuu...
M5500_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=There are many damaged parts. But, they aren't wounds that can't be repaired.
M5500_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Please wait here a little. I'll gather materials and come back right away!
M5500_S0060_G0070_001_pod042="Shape Memory Alloy" is required to repair this android.
M5500_S0060_G0080_001_pod153="Shape Memory Alloy" is required to repair this android.
M5500_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=Pascal!? Why are you here?
M5500_S0060_G0100_001_pascal=I was worried about the two androids who were in my village, so I've been searching for them all along.
M5500_S0060_G0110_001_pascal=Then this person's signal suddenly became weak, so...
M5500_S0060_G0120_001_pascal=Are those repair materials? Please lend them to me, I will fix her.
M5500_S0060_G0130_001_a9s=Got it!
M5500_S0060_G0140_001_pascal=............
M5500_S0060_G0150_001_a9s=What's wrong?
M5500_S0060_G0160_001_pascal=The android is female, so if you could just close your eyes...
M5500_S0060_G0170_001_a9s=Wah! Sorry. That's right! I'll close them! I'll close my eyes right now!
M5500_S0060_G0180_001_pascal=Take this... do this... do that...
M5500_S0060_G0190_001_pascal=Yes! It is done!
M5500_S0060_G0200_001_pascal=...Phew, she should be okay with this.
M5500_S0060_G0210_001_andwoman=Thank you for saving me. By the way, is he safe?
M5500_S0060_G0220_001_a9s=Yes, he is safe. Please be reli...
M5500_S0060_G0230_001_andman=Thank god, you were safe!
M5500_S0060_G0240_001_andwoman=Ah...!
M5500_S0060_G0250_001_andman=I'm sorry, if only I were stronger...!
M5500_S0060_G0260_001_andwoman=No, it's fine. If you are safe, then I am...
M5500_S0060_G0270_001_andman=We caused you trouble. Truly, I am sorry.
M5500_S0060_G0280_001_pascal=Not at all. More importantly, what will you do after this?
M5500_S0060_G0290_001_andman=...For now, we have to find a safe place.
M5500_S0060_G0300_001_andwoman=Going on a wandering journey again? While being chased by former comrades, while being frightened by Machine Lifeforms...
M5500_S0060_G0310_001_andwoman=I can't stand that anymore!
M5500_S0060_G0320_001_andman=But...
M5500_S0060_G0330_001_andwoman=...Hey... if it's come to this, let's return to the Resistance Camp.
M5500_S0060_G0340_001_andwoman=If we initialize our memories and become clean, even Anemone-san should welcome us back...
M5500_S0060_G0350_001_andman=But, if we initialize... even these feelings for you...
M5500_S0060_G0360_001_andwoman=Even if we stay together like this, I will come to hate you.
M5500_S0060_G0370_001_andwoman=Even if I'm initialized, I'm sure I will come to like you.
M5500_S0060_G0380_001_andman=...Alright.
M5500_S0060_G0390_001_andwoman=Please. Erase our memories! And, take us to the Resistance Camp!
M5500_S0060_G0400_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5500_S0060_G0410_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5500_S0060_G0420_001_andwoman=Please... erase our memories.
M5500_S0060_G0430_001_andman=...Thank you. Well then, start with me.
M5500_S0060_G0435_001_pascal=To go as far as erasing memories... you two must be very close.
M5500_S0060_G0440_001_a9s=Understood...
M5500_S0060_G0450_001_a9s=...Format complete. He will reboot in a while.
M5500_S0060_G0460_001_a9s=Next is... you, right?
M5500_S0060_G0470_001_andwoman=Ah, I'm fine.
M5500_S0060_G0480_001_a9s=...Eh?
M5500_S0060_G0490_001_andwoman=...Looks like the format went well. As expected of the latest YoRHa model.
M5500_S0060_G0500_001_a9s=W-Wait a minute. What on earth are you...
M5500_S0060_G0510_001_andwoman=Look, we are too weak, right?
M5500_S0060_G0520_001_andwoman=So, I thought, why not modify one of us into a combat type? If we do that, there's no need to run away.
M5500_S0060_G0530_001_andwoman=But, initialization was necessary for that. That's why I had you format only him.
M5500_S0060_G0540_001_andwoman=Now then, from now on I have to make this person strong. Ah, while I'm at it, maybe I'll change his slightly pathetic personality too. I prefer someone a little more forceful.
M5500_S0060_G0550_001_a9s=...
M5500_S0060_G0560_001_andwoman=Don't let it bother you. After all, this is the sixth format.
M5500_S0060_G0570_001_andwoman=You really took care of us. I don't know if this counts as thanks, but...
M5500_S0060_G0580_001_andwoman=Well then, I'm going now. The next time you see him, he'll surely be amazing!
M5500_S0060_G0590_001_pascal=Umm, in short, what does this mean?
M5500_S0060_G0600_001_a9s=...Women are scary.
M5500_S0060_G0610_001_pascal=Women are scary... I will remember that.
