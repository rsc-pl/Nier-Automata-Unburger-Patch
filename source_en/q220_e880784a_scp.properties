M5220_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2-san. Did you need something?
M5220_S0010_G0010_001_a2=...You gave me that filter for free.
M5220_S0010_G0020_001_a2=I won't be satisfied until I return the favor.
M5220_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=My, that is very conscientious of you...
M5220_S0010_G0040_001_a2=If there's anything I can help with, I'll do it.
M5220_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=...Actually, there is something I'm troubled by.
M5220_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=A ferocious robot has started appearing at the playground and attacking the children.
M5220_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=This is presumptuous of me, but would you be willing to exterminate that robot for us?
M5220_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=I can't ask anyone else to do something like this. Please.
M5220_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Accept.
M5220_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Refuse.
M5220_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=...You're right, of course. You have your own things to attend to.
M5220_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Please forgive me.
M5220_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=Could you please exterminate the ferocious robot that's appearing at the children's playground?
M5220_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=Thank you so much!
M5220_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=I will be sure to reward you properly, so please, I'm counting on you.
M5220_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=Please exterminate the robot that's rampaging at the children's playground.
M5220_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=Please, I'm counting on you.
M5220_S0020_G0005_001_pod042=Detected hostile Machine Lifeform.
M5220_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, thank you so much!
M5220_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=You exterminated that robot for us.
M5220_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=Please, accept this reward. Here, don't be shy.
M5220_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=...We are pacifists. We created this village because we hate to fight.
M5220_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=But as a result of throwing away our weapons, we've lost the means to resist those with power.
M5220_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=Within the village, there are even those who claim we should destroy the surrounding enemies to protect our peace.
M5220_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=A2-san... what should we do?
M5220_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Who knows.
M5220_S0030_G0080_001_a2=You're the one who has to decide that, Pascal. Aren't you?
M5220_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=That... is true...
M5220_S0030_G0100_001_a2=Also, if anything attacks me, I'll destroy this village without hesitation.
M5220_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=...Haha. Understood.
M5220_S0030_G0120_001_pascal=A2-san.
M5220_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=If you like, please take a look around the village.
M5220_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=I want you to know more about us.
M5220_S0030_G0150_001_a2=...If I feel like it.
