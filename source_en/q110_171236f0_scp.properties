M5110_S0010_G0000_001_roboane=Excuse me! Please, listen!
M5110_S0010_G0001_300_sister=Thank you so much for bringing my Younger Sister back.
M5110_S0010_G0002_300_sister=Thanks to the part my sister found for me, my body's condition has improved.
M5110_S0010_G0003_300_youngsister=Thank you for coming to find me earlier.
M5110_S0010_G0004_300_youngsister=I won't do anything to make Older Sister worry anymore.
M5110_S0010_G0007_300_sister=Please accept this as a token of my thanks.
M5110_S0010_G0010_001_roboane=Please! I beg you!
M5110_S0010_G0020_001_roboane=Um, excuse me! Won't you please look for my Younger Sister? She's lost.
M5110_S0010_G0021_001_sele=Search for her.
M5110_S0010_G0022_001_sele=Do not search for her.
M5110_S0010_G0030_001_roboane=It's all my fault, really...
M5110_S0010_G0040_001_roboane=It's because I was grumbling in front of her about how my parts were in bad shape.
M5110_S0010_G0050_001_roboane=She got worried and went to the desert to find replacement parts for me.
M5110_S0010_G0060_001_roboane=But she hasn't come back for several days... I'll give you a reward, so please, I beg of you!
M5110_S0010_G0070_001_roboane=Please, find my Younger Sister who's lost in the desert!
M5110_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=An older sister who cares so much for her younger sister...
M5110_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=That said, Machine Lifeform sisters is a strange concept, isn't it?
M5110_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Were they made in the same factory, or something?
M5110_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=Who knows...
M5110_S0020_G0000_001_pascal=2B-san, 9S-san.
M5110_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Whoa, Pascal?
M5110_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=I'm sorry for the sudden transmission.
M5110_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=I heard what happened. You're searching for the lost child, I believe?
M5110_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=I ask this of you as well. Please, find her quickly.
M5110_S0020_G0050_001_pascal=She is a good child who cares for her sister.
M5110_S0020_G0060_001_pascal=I believe she is most likely in the Desert Zone.
M5110_S0020_G0070_001_pascal=Because the part her sister needs, a "Dented Metal Board," can be found nearby...
M5110_S0020_G0080_001_a2b=Understood.
M5110_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=Thank you very much. Both of you, please be careful.
M5110_S0030_G0000_001_roboimouto=Uu... I want to go hoome... Onee-saaan...
M5110_S0030_G0001_001_a9s=Is that...
M5110_S0030_G0010_001_roboimouto=Uuuuu...
M5110_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Hello there. Are you, by chance, the robot who came here looking for parts?
M5110_S0030_G0030_001_roboimouto=O-Onii-chan, Onee-chan... Who are you?
M5110_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=We were asked by your older sister to come find you.
M5110_S0030_G0050_001_roboimouto=By her? Really?
M5110_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Really. So let's go back together, okay?
M5110_S0030_G0070_001_roboimouto=U... Waaaaaah! I was scaaared! I was so scaaaared!
M5110_S0030_G0080_001_a2b=Then all that's left is to take this child to Pascal's Village...
M5110_S0030_G0090_001_a9s=But why were you wandering around a place like this?
M5110_S0030_G0110_001_roboimouto=I was looking for... Onee-san's part...
M5110_S0030_G0120_001_roboimouto=And I got scared... and I couldn't move... Waaaaaaah!
M5110_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Ah, don't cry.
M5110_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=So? Did you find the part?
M5110_S0030_G0150_001_roboimouto=Yeah... Will Onee-san be happy?
M5110_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=I'm sure she will. But I think she'll be even happier if you return safely.
M5110_S0030_G0170_001_roboimouto=...Yeah.
M5110_S0030_G0180_001_a2b=9S... I can't find the lost child.
M5110_S0030_G0190_001_a9s=Huh!? ...You're right.
M5110_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Where could we have gotten separated...?
M5110_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=Should we try going back to where we found her?
M5110_S0030_G0220_001_roboimouto=U... Waaaaaah! I was scaaared! I was so scaaaared!
M5110_S0030_G0230_001_roboimouto=Onii-chan... Onee-chan... You disappeared...
M5110_S0030_G0240_001_a9s=Sorry, sorry. We'll make sure not to lose sight of you from now on.
M5110_S0030_G0250_001_roboimouto=Hey, why was the desert made?
M5110_S0030_G0260_001_a9s=Ummm... The vegetation was lost because of a decrease in rainfall,
M5110_S0030_G0270_001_a9s=and then the soil changed...
M5110_S0030_G0280_001_roboimouto=What's soil?
M5110_S0030_G0290_001_a9s=Ah, soil is the dirt on the ground.
M5110_S0030_G0300_001_roboimouto=Woow! Dirt is amazing!
M5110_S0030_G0310_001_roboimouto=Hey, where does the wind blow from?
M5110_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=That's due to changes in air temperature and pressure...
M5110_S0030_G0330_001_a9s=Or rather, I wonder where the wind actually does blow from.
M5110_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=It's kind of a philosophical question, too... right, 2B?
M5110_S0030_G0350_001_a2b=Don't ask me.
M5110_S0030_G0360_001_roboimouto=Hey, how are children born?
M5110_S0030_G0370_001_a9s=Well...
M5110_S0030_G0380_001_a9s=Actually, neither Machine Lifeforms nor androids can make children...
M5110_S0030_G0390_001_roboimouto=So how do you make children?
M5110_S0030_G0400_001_a9s=2B...
M5110_S0030_G0410_001_a2b=D-Don't look at me with that voice. I can't help you.
M5110_S0030_G0420_001_a9s=Ugh...
M5110_S0030_G0430_001_roboimouto=Hey, so children...
M5110_S0030_G0440_001_a9s=Let's hurry! Look, your older sister is waiting!
M5110_S0040_G0000_001_roboimouto=If we're this far, it's okaaay! I can get home by myself!
M5110_S0040_G0010_001_roboimouto=Thanks for showing me the way. Here, I'll give you this!
M5110_S0040_G0020_001_roboimouto=See ya, Onii-chan, Onee-chan, Bye-byeee!
M5110_S0040_G0030_001_roboimouto=Next time, teeeaaach me how to make childreeeen!
M5110_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=......
M5110_S0040_G0050_001_a2b=......
M5110_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=I feel... suddenly exhausted.
M5110_S0040_G0070_001_a2b=...Indeed.
