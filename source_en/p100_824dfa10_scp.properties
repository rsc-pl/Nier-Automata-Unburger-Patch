M1030_S0010_G0111_001_op210=From Operator to 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=Yes. This is 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0113_001_op210=There is a message from the Commander to both 2B and 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Playing now.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=Several YoRHa units heading to the surface have lost contact.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=Since the black box signal is still being detected, it is presumed that there are no fatalities.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We have narrowed down the point where the signals are being emitted,
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=so I order YoRHa unit members currently staying on the surface to investigate this matter.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=That is all. Ending communication.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Come to think of it... I heard a similar story at the Resistance Camp...
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=I've set the target point information.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=I feel like we should go as soon as possible.
M1030_S0015_G0000_001_ane=Ah, it's you guys.
M1030_S0015_G0010_001_ane=I heard the story about the Machine Lifeforms in the desert from Jackass. That must have been rough.
M1030_S0015_G0020_001_ane=It's not much of a reward, but I've prepared a room for you YoRHa.
M1030_S0015_G0030_001_a2b=A room?
M1030_S0015_G0040_001_ane=Since the YoRHa unit has been looking out for me...\nfeel free to use it whenever you need.
M1030_S0015_G0050_001_a9s=Thank you very much!
