M1060_S0070_G0000_001_a2b=This is... a machine lifeform!?
M1060_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=It's huge... I've never seen anything like it...
M1060_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=Damn... It's using EMP attacks to keep us from getting close...
M1060_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=We have to find another way to attack it...
M1060_S0070_G0090_021_op210=Notification from Operator 21O to 9S.
M1060_S0070_G0100_021_op=The decision has been made to execute a direct attack with the satellite laser.
M1060_S0070_G0110_021_op210=To stabilize the targeting, please destroy the enemy's EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0120_021_a9s=An EMP generator...?
M1060_S0070_G0130_021_op210=Transferring specific coordinates as map data.
M1060_S0070_G0131_011_pod042=Confirmed position of EMP generator. Marking on map.
M1060_S0070_G0132_011_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0140_011_pod042=Notification: Enemy intel acquired from Command.
M1060_S0070_G0150_011_a2b=Open the intel.

M1060_S0070_G0170_011_pod042=After making landfall, it executed an ultra-high-intensity electromagnetic wave attack.
M1060_S0070_G0180_011_pod042=During the battle at that time, the Resistance escort unit was annihilated.
M1060_S0070_G0190_011_a2b=In other words, if we don't stop it from landing, that tragedy will happen again...
