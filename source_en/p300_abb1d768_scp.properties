M3000_S0040_G0000_001_op210=...Those are your orders. Did you understand?
M3000_S0040_G0000_300_op210=The target is surmised to be in a high place with good signal conditions. \nPlease check the rooftops of buildings and such.
M3000_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Errr...
M3000_S0040_G0010_300_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0020_001_a9s=We Scanner units will paralyze the enemy's air defense system via hacking \nin preparation for the all-out attack.
M3000_S0040_G0020_300_op210=Please be absolutely sure not to destroy the target. \nEven if you destroy it, a replacement unit will appear after a while and there will be no end to it.
M3000_S0040_G0030_001_op210=That is correct. Well done.
M3000_S0040_G0030_300_a9s=Yes, yes. I won't do thaaat.
M3000_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=Am I... being treated like a child?
M3000_S0040_G0040_300_op210=Please be careful as the target's appearance is the same as a standard unit. \nHowever, if you approach the target, a marker will be displayed.
M3000_S0040_G0050_001_op210=It is your imagination.
M3000_S0040_G0050_300_a9s=I feel like those guys are rapidly getting smarter somehow.
M3000_S0040_G0060_001_op210=The Machine Lifeforms receiving the air defense system signals,
M3000_S0040_G0060_300_op210=Ah. You destroyed it again, didn't you...
M3000_S0040_G0070_001_op210=Should be in high places with good signal conditions.
M3000_S0040_G0070_300_op210=You have to hack them *squeeze*! *Squeeze*! \nI believe a replacement enemy will be deployed, so please do it right next time.
M3000_S0040_G0071_001_op210=I have transferred the rough predicted locations \nof the hacking target Machine Lifeforms to the map.
M3000_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0080_300_a9s=Roger that.
M3000_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Oh no...
M3000_S0040_G0090_300_op210=It seems you succeeded in hacking. \nYou are a good boy.
M3000_S0040_G0100_001_op210=9S. The order is hacking, not destruction.
M3000_S0040_G0100_300_a9s=I knew I was being treated like a child...
M3000_S0040_G0110_001_op210=Because if you break them, they will be redeployed, so it is meaningless.
M3000_S0040_G0110_300_op210=I'm counting on you for the next one too.
M3000_S0040_G0120_001_op210=Sneak up softly from behind the enemy's field of view...
M3000_S0040_G0120_300_a9s=...Okaaay.
M3000_S0040_G0130_001_op210=Please hack them *squeeze*.
M3000_S0040_G0130_300_op210=Defense system operating rate decline confirmed.
M3000_S0040_G0140_001_a9s=I know...
M3000_S0040_G0140_300_a9s=Just a little more.
M3000_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=What is "hack them *squeeze*"...
M3000_S0040_G0150_300_op210=Enemy defense system completely silent. \nYou can do it if you try, can't you?
M3000_S0040_G0151_001_pod153=Report: Impossible to directly hack the target Large-scale Machine Lifeform.
M3000_S0040_G0152_001_pod153=Special protection detected. \nIt appears to be refusing access from anything other than Machine Lifeforms.
M3000_S0040_G0153_001_pod153=Proposal: First take over a small-type enemy, and use that enemy to hack the large-type enemy.
M3000_S0040_G0154_001_a9s=So I should just hack in multiple stages...
M3000_S0040_G0160_001_op210=It seems to be going smoothly.
M3000_S0040_G0160_300_a9s=I can always do it...
M3000_S0040_G0170_001_op210=In this operation, other Scanner squad members have also been fully mobilized.
M3000_S0040_G0170_300_op210=Since it is a wonderful result, I have prepared a reward.
M3000_S0040_G0180_001_op210=We must make sure not to fall behind either.
M3000_S0040_G0180_300_op210=I will leave it in my room, so please come to pick it up later.
M3000_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=Okaaay. I'll make sure not to fall behiiind.
M3000_S0040_G0190_300_a9s=...A reward?
M3000_S0040_G0200_001_op210=9S.
M3000_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=What?
M3000_S0040_G0220_001_op210=Please stay away from that area as much as possible during combat.
M3000_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=If I do that, I can't provide support though.
M3000_S0040_G0240_001_op210=Scanner models like you are not suited for combat.
M3000_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Huh? Are you worried about me?
M3000_S0040_G0260_001_op210=No. Because even if you are on the battlefield, you are just a burden.
M3000_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=That's too cruel.
M3000_S0040_G0280_001_a11s=11S to 9S. Can you hear me?
M3000_S0040_G0290_001_a9s=I hear you~.
M3000_S0040_G0300_001_a11s=My assigned tasks are all finished. How about there?
M3000_S0040_G0310_001_a9s=Here too... just one left I guess.
M3000_S0040_G0320_001_a11s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0330_001_a11s=Also, when you return to the Bunker, please sync your data.
M3000_S0040_G0340_001_a9s=Ah... I forgot.
M3000_S0040_G0350_001_a11s=Since your combat data hasn't been submitted, the entire Scanner model line cannot update.
M3000_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Roger. I'll handle it once this operation is finished.
M3000_S0040_G0370_001_a11s=I'm counting on you~.
M3000_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Phew... Is that the whole allotment?
M3000_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=It's started...
M3000_S0050_G0020_001_pod153=Proposal: Rendezvous with 2B before the combat situation worsens.
M3000_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=I know.
M3000_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=Ummm, marking the rendezvous point with 2B on the map... and there.
M5920_S0020_G0310_001_pod153=Alert: Departing from scheduled operational zone.
M5920_S0020_G0320_001_pod153=Recommendation: Immediate return to operational zone.
