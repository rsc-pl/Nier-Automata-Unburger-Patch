M5180_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Huh? Operator-san, what are you doing?
M5180_S0010_G0010_001_op210=What, you ask? Data analysis.
M5180_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=Data analysis? Is that your current mission?
M5180_S0010_G0030_001_op210=No? Just a hobby.
M5180_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Just a hobby... why would you do such a thing...
M5180_S0010_G0050_001_op210=Coordinate data, communication log data, photographed image data... \nThere is lots of data in the world.
M5180_S0010_G0060_001_op210=There is information that becomes newly visible by analyzing that data.
M5180_S0010_G0070_001_op210=My hobby is discovering that information.
M5180_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Data analysis... feels like it wouldn't be interesting.
M5180_S0010_G0090_001_op210=I judge it to be more useful than useless small talk with you, at least.
M5180_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=That's mean!
M5180_S0010_G0110_001_op210=Ah, there is a good method to make this small talk not useless.
M5180_S0010_G0120_001_op210=There is an information terminal in the abandoned factory grounds that cannot be accessed from satellite.
M5180_S0010_G0130_001_op210=Please access those terminals and transfer the information.
M5180_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Got it! I'll check it right away!
M5180_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Eeh? That's a pain...
M5180_S0010_G0160_001_op210=Good answer. Then I will transmit the position coordinates you should investigate.
M5180_S0010_G0165_001_op210=The terminal is in a hard-to-find place inside the factory, so please be careful.
M5180_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=Yees. Then, once I check it I'll contact you again~
M5180_S0010_G0180_001_op210=Then I will transmit the position coordinates you should investigate.
M5180_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Eeh!? I didn't say I'd investigate!
M5180_S0010_G0200_001_op210=Because you didn't say you wouldn't investigate either.
M5180_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=That's mean!
M5180_S0010_G0211_001_op210=The terminal is in a hard-to-find place inside the factory, so please do your best to look for it.
M5180_S0010_G0220_001_op210=I asked you for information investigation at the abandoned factory grounds.
M5180_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=This factory has become like a nest for Machine Lifeforms.
M5180_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=I wonder what kind of place it was before...
M5180_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Reference Result: Weapons production factory from when human civilization was healthy.
M5180_S0020_G0030_001_pod153=They conducted weapons production and experiments.
M5180_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Hee... what kind of weapons did they make?
M5180_S0020_G0050_001_pod153=Mainly manufactured humanoid weapons. Representative model names P-22, P-33.
M5180_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=Humanoid weapons huh. I wonder if they were like Flight Units.
M5180_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=Photographic materials of said weapons do not currently exist.
M5180_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Looks like I can access data from over there...
M5180_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=I was able to obtain the data the Operator was talking about.
M5180_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=After this, I just have to transmit this data.
M5180_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Report: Radio signal strength in this location is insufficient.
M5180_S0030_G0040_001_pod153=Recommendation: Move to a location with good communication environment.
M5180_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=Roger.
M5180_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Communication is possible here...
M5180_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Pod. Upload data addressed to the Operator.
M5180_S0030_G0080_001_pod153=Roger.
M5180_S0030_G0090_001_op210=From Operator 21O to 9S. Please respond.
M5180_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Yes. This is 9S.
M5180_S0030_G0110_001_op210=I confirmed receipt of the data.
M5180_S0030_G0120_001_op210=I am currently analyzing it but... this is interesting.
M5180_S0030_G0130_001_op210=This data seems to be the diary of a human who worked at the factory in the past.
M5180_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Diary?
M5180_S0030_G0150_001_op210=According to that diary, he labored at the factory for long hours every day,
M5180_S0030_G0160_001_op210=but it is recorded that "It's like I'm working like a machine."
M5180_S0030_G0170_001_op210=Becoming like a machine, to make machines at a factory... \nHumanity is strange.
M5180_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=I see...
M5180_S0030_G0190_001_op210=I will send a special reward by email later.
M5180_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Reward? I can get a reward?
M5180_S0030_G0210_001_op210=I didn't say a single word about not giving a reward.
M5180_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Well, that is true but~
M5180_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=...Wait, communication cut off.
M5920_S0020_G0180_001_pod153=Report: Mail reception notification from Access Point.
