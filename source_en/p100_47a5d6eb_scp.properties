M1040_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=Are they all... waving white flags?
M1040_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=2B, I know you're not thrilled about this, but why don't we hear what the Machine Lifeforms have to say? I'm curious about what they want.
M1040_S0030_G0005_300_a9s=Proposal: Investigate the Machine Lifeform settlement.\nReporting to Command is difficult with the information currently available.
M1040_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=Does this mean... they have no will to fight?
M1040_S0030_G0010_300_a2b=9S, let's go back and get that information from the Machine Lifeforms.
M1040_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=There's definitely something... strange about this village.
M1040_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=Let's head back and check it out.
M1040_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=...First of all,
M1040_S0030_G0100_001_pascal=there is something I would like you to hear.
M1040_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=We are not your enemies.
M1040_S0030_G0120_001_a9s=2B! You can't believe a word these Machine Lifeforms say!
M1040_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=...It is true that to you, we Machine Lifeforms are the enemy.
M1040_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=My name is Pascal. I am the leader of this village.
M1040_S0030_G0150_001_pascal=The ones who live in this village... are only pacifists who have fled from the fighting.
M1040_S0030_G0160_001_pascal=If you would be so kind, please see for yourselves...
M1040_S0030_G0170_001_pascal=What do you think?
M1040_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Whoa... He opened a comm channel without permission...
M1040_S0030_G0190_001_pascal=Do you understand now that we are lovers of peace?
M1040_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Anyone can say that...
M1040_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=Machines don't have hearts.
M1040_S0030_G0220_001_pascal=...That may be so.
M1040_S0030_G0230_001_pascal=But please, feel free to visit this village again in the future.
M1040_S0030_G0240_001_pascal=Mutual understanding can only be achieved through dialogue... or so I believe.
M1040_S0030_G0250_001_a2b=I see...
M1040_S0031_G0000_001_pascal=Oh, that's right. We also have dealings with you androids.
M1040_S0031_G0010_001_pascal=Please take this to Anemone-san at the Resistance Camp.
M1040_S0031_G0020_001_a9s=What is this...?
M1040_S0031_G0030_001_pascal=It is a fuel filtration filter that Anemone-san requested.
M1040_S0031_G0040_001_pascal=I believe that if you deliver it to her, you will understand that we are a peaceful people.
M1040_S0031_G0050_001_a2b=...Understood.
M1040_S0031_G0060_001_a9s=Anemone-san, we have something for you from a Machine Lifeform named Pascal...
M1040_S0031_G0070_001_ane=Ah, the fuel filter? I was just running low.
M1040_S0031_G0080_001_ane=...Wait a sec, you met Pascal?
M1040_S0031_G0090_001_a9s=We did... Anemone-san, you're in contact with Machine Lifeforms?
M1040_S0031_G0100_001_ane=...Yeah. The folk in that village are harmless, and they're good at the kind of detailed work we can't do.
M1040_S0031_G0110_001_ane=In exchange, we give them things like oil and materials. It's a kind of trade.
M1040_S0031_G0120_001_a9s=I... see.
M1040_S0031_G0130_001_ane=If you're heading back, take this high-viscosity oil to Pascal for me.
M1040_S0031_G0140_001_ane=When you see Pascal, give him this high-viscosity oil.
M1040_S0031_G0150_001_ane=Sorry to always be relying on you... Oh, right.
M1040_S0031_G0160_001_ane=I've prepared a private room for you YoRHa units.
M1040_S0031_G0170_001_ane=Use it whenever you like.
M1040_S0031_G0180_001_pascal=Ah! You've brought the high-viscosity oil.
M1040_S0031_G0190_001_pascal=Anemone-san is so kind and understanding. It's a great help.
M1040_S0031_G0200_001_pascal=It would be wonderful if all androids and Machine Lifeforms could live in peace like this...
M1040_S0031_G0210_001_a9s=...That's nothing but a fantasy.
M1040_S0031_G0220_001_pascal=You may be right... If you'd like, please try talking with the other robots as well.
M5920_S0090_G0130_001_human=This is a message from the Council of Humanity on the moon to all androids fighting valiantly on the surface.
M5920_S0090_G0140_001_human=Several thousand years have passed since the attack by the aliens and their vanguard, the Machine Lifeforms.
M5920_S0090_G0150_001_human=As a result, we humans were forced to flee to the moon.
M5920_S0090_G0160_001_human=However, it is because of your continued struggle that we are able to endure.
M5920_S0090_G0170_001_human=You android soldiers are truly the last hope for us humans.
M5920_S0090_G0180_001_human=We await news of your valiant efforts.
M5920_S0090_G0190_001_human=Glory to Mankind.
M5920_S0100_G0080_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B-san. It's time for our regular check-in... *sob*... Waaah!
M5920_S0100_G0090_001_a2b=This is 2B. What's wrong?
M5920_S0100_G0100_001_op60=Well, I asked a senior I kinda liked out to eat, and he turned me down...
M5920_S0100_G0110_001_op60=How am I supposed to go on living now... 2B-san...?
M5920_S0100_G0120_001_a2b=I-I wouldn't know... how to answer that.
M5920_S0100_G0130_001_op60=I can't stay at the Bunker anymore...
M5920_S0100_G0140_001_a2b=...That would be a problem. It would interfere with the mission.
M5920_S0100_G0150_001_op60=...2B-san, does that mean you need me?
M5920_S0100_G0160_001_a2b=An operator's support is indispensable for a B-Type combat model.
M5920_S0100_G0170_001_a2b=So...
M5920_S0100_G0180_001_op60=2B-san...
M5920_S0100_G0190_001_a2b=...That's all. Communication terminated.
M5920_S0100_G0380_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. Commencing regular check-in.
M5920_S0100_G0390_001_op210=I have an important matter to discuss with you today, 9S.
M5920_S0100_G0400_001_a9s=What is it?
M5920_S0100_G0410_001_op210=A complaint has been filed by the Maintenance Department regarding your handling of your flight unit.
M5920_S0100_G0420_001_op210=They've requested that you stop modifying it without permission.
M5920_S0100_G0430_001_a9s=Well, yeah, but the satellite data feed had a bunch of junk in it that was slowing down the targeting correction, so I had no choice...
M5920_S0100_G0440_001_op210=If you have an objection, please go to the Maintenance Department yourself and resolve the matter by either talking it out or punching it out.
M5920_S0100_G0450_001_op210=That is all.
M5920_S0100_G0460_001_a9s=...You know, Operators are surprisingly rough, aren't they?
