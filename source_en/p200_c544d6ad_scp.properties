M1050_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Um...
M1050_S0020_G0000_300_a9s=Let's try talking to him some more. We might learn something about the Machine Lifeforms.
M1050_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Ah, 9S-san and 2B-san.
M1050_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=That Machine Lifeform rampage the other day was quite terrible, wasn't it...
M1050_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=I have a few questions for you.
M1050_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Of course. Ask me anything I am able to answer.
M1050_S0020_G0050_001_sele=Ask about Pascal's pacifism.
M1050_S0020_G0060_001_sele=Ask about the aliens.
M1050_S0020_G0070_001_sele=Ask about other Machine Lifeforms.
M1050_S0020_G0080_001_sele=Ask nothing.
M1050_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=I see. If you think of anything else you're curious about, please ask me anytime.
M1050_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=Pascal. Why don't you fight?
M1050_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=...We have lived for many hundreds of years.
M1050_S0020_G0120_001_pascal=In that time, we lost our comrades again and again.
M1050_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=However, losing my comrades was not what I feared.
M1050_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=I became afraid of the part of myself that was growing used to my comrades dying.
M1050_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=That is why... I decided I would fight no more.
M1050_S0020_G0160_001_a2b=Do you know anything about the aliens?
M1050_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=The aliens... You mean our creators.
M1050_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=My apologies. I actually do not know very much.
M1050_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=For the past few hundred years, there have been no messages from them. We have been fighting independently.
M1050_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=...Indeed. The fact that commands from the aliens stopped coming is one of the reasons we became pacifists.
M1050_S0040_G0080_001_a2b=...Pascal.
M1050_S0040_G0090_001_pascal=Yes? What is it?
M1050_S0040_G0100_001_a2b=Other than this village, are there any other Machine Lifeforms disconnected from the network?
M1050_S0040_G0110_001_pascal=Other than this village...
M1050_S0040_G0120_001_pascal=Well, the Opera Singer at the amusement park that you two defeated recently was one such case.
M1050_S0040_G0130_001_a9s=The Opera Singer... you mean that thing?
M1050_S0040_G0140_001_pascal=Ah, and there are also some in the "Forest Country," but...
M1050_S0040_G0150_001_a2b=Forest Country?
M1050_S0040_G0160_001_pascal=Yes. There is a large forest nearby,
M1050_S0040_G0170_001_pascal=and the Machine Lifeforms there have gathered to form their own country.
M1050_S0040_G0180_001_pascal=They are a very exclusive group. Even we are unable to approach...
M1050_S0040_G0190_001_a2b=Where is it?
M1050_S0040_G0200_001_pascal=It lies northeast of the City Ruins.
M1050_S0040_G0210_001_pascal=You should be able to reach it by going through the ruins of a large commercial facility...
M1050_S0040_G0220_001_pascal=But that area has become quite dangerous lately, so please be careful.
M1050_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=The Forest Country... sounds like it's worth investigating.
