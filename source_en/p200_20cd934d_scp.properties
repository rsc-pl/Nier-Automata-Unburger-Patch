M1060_S0070_G0000_001_a2b=This is... a Machine Lifeform!?
M1060_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=One this big... I've never seen anything like it...
M1060_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=Damn... It's preventing us from getting close with EMP attacks...
M1060_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=We have to attack it by some other method somehow...
M1060_S0070_G0090_021_op210=Notification from Operator 21O to 9S.
M1060_S0070_G0100_021_op=It has been decided to carry out a direct attack with the satellite laser.
M1060_S0070_G0110_021_op210=To stabilize the aim, please destroy the enemy's EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0120_021_a9s=An EMP generator...?
M1060_S0070_G0130_021_op210=Transferring specific coordinates as map data.
M1060_S0070_G0131_011_pod042=Confirmed position of EMP generator. Marking on map.
M1060_S0070_G0132_011_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0140_011_pod042=Notification: Obtained enemy information from Command.
M1060_S0070_G0150_011_a2b=Open the information.
M1060_S0070_G0160_011_pod042=The giant Machine Lifeform has only one record, confirmed 320 years ago.
M1060_S0070_G0170_011_pod042=After landing, it carried out an ultra-high-intensity electromagnetic wave attack.
M1060_S0070_G0180_011_pod042=In the battle at that time, the Resistance escort unit was annihilated.
M1060_S0070_G0190_011_a2b=In other words, if we don't stop its landing, a tragedy will occur again...
M1060_S0070_G0200_011_pod042=Supporting that deduction.
M1060_S0070_G0230_021_op210=Confirmed disappearance of jamming electromagnetic waves.
M1060_S0070_G0240_021_op210=Satellite laser attack, impacting.
