M5290_S0010_G0000_001_robocreator=Yaa! Are you having fun?
M5290_S0010_G0000_300_robocreator=Will you cooperate with me?
M5290_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=In a place like this, there's no way I could be having fun, right?
M5290_S0010_G0010_300_sele=Cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0020_001_robocreator=That's truuuue. Even though it's an Amusement Park, there's nothing decent to play wiiiith.
M5290_S0010_G0020_300_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0030_001_robocreator=So, I'm thinking of making a Game!
M5290_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Huh? A game?
M5290_S0010_G0050_001_robocreator=Yup! A fun game that everyone can play. But, I just don't have enough materiaaaals.
M5290_S0010_G0060_001_robocreator=So with that said, won't you cooperate a little?
M5290_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0090_001_robocreator=Thank you! The necessary material is a "Tri-color Cable." I'm counting on yoooou.
M5290_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=If you know the materials, why don't you gather them yourself?
M5290_S0010_G0110_001_robocreator=You can steal "Tri-color Cables" from Machine Lifeforms inside the Amusement Park, but I hate killing comraaaades!
M5290_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Then you should just give up on making a game.
M5290_S0010_G0130_001_robocreator=For the sake of Creation, I do not choose the means!
M5290_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=You're contradicting yourself...
M5290_S0010_G0150_001_robocreator=I want to make a game everyone can play. So, won't you cooperate in gathering materials?
M5290_S0020_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! That's a "Tri-color Cable." Will you give that to me?
M5290_S0020_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, wait just a moment. If I connect this...
M5290_S0020_G0020_001_robocreator=Look! The game is ready to plaaay!
M5290_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Huh, what kind of game?
M5290_S0020_G0040_001_robocreator=It's a shooting game. But, I feel like there are buuuugs...
M5290_S0020_G0041_001_robocreator=Will you go play the game?
M5290_S0020_G0042_001_sele=Play.
M5290_S0020_G0043_001_sele=Do not play.
M5290_S0020_G0044_001_robocreator=If possible, while you play, I want you to debug it.
M5290_S0020_G0050_001_robocreator=Congrats on the clear! Did you enjoy it?
M5290_S0020_G0051_001_robocreator=You found the bug! Thank you!
M5290_S0020_G0060_001_robocreator=But honestly, I want to make a game with higher difficulty.
M5290_S0020_G0070_001_robocreator=So with that said, could you bring me a "Four-color Cable" this time?
M5290_S0020_G0071_001_robocreator=Passion is... gushing forth... The passion to create a more wonderful game...
M5290_S0020_G0072_001_robocreator=So, could you bring a "Four-color Cable" to me, filled with such enthusiasm?
M5290_S0020_G0080_001_sele=I'll bring it.
M5290_S0020_G0080_300_robocreator=Enjoy the game!
M5290_S0020_G0090_001_sele=I won't bring it.
M5290_S0020_G0090_300_robocreator=Come back whenever you want to play a game!
M5290_S0020_G0100_001_robocreator=Xie xie! If I recall, a Machine Lifeform in the Abandoned Factory had the "Four-color Cable"...
M5290_S0020_G0101_300_robocreator=It was a weird guy walking away from his comrades.
M5290_S0020_G0110_001_robocreator=Well then, I'm counting on yoooou.
M5290_S0020_G0120_001_robocreator=I want to make a slightly more difficult game, so could you bring me a "Four-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0020_G0120_300_robocreator=In this state, I can't enjoy Creation... Please do something!
M5290_S0020_G0122_300_robocreator=The guy holding the "Tri-color Cable" is warlike, so be careful!
M5290_S0020_G0130_001_robocreator=Xie xie! If I recall, a Machine Lifeform in the Abandoned Factory had the "Four-color Cable"...
M5290_S0020_G0131_300_robocreator=It was a weird guy walking away from his comrades.
M5290_S0030_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! That's a "Four-color Cable." Will you give that to me?
M5290_S0030_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, wait just a moment. Connect this...
M5290_S0030_G0020_001_robocreator=Okay! The difficulty has gone up a little!
M5290_S0030_G0030_001_robocreator=There's a reward if you find a bug, so try playing iiiit.
M5290_S0030_G0031_001_robocreator=Were you able to enjoy it?
M5290_S0030_G0032_001_robocreator=Thanks for finding the bug!
M5290_S0030_G0040_001_robocreator=However, honestly, I want to make a game with even higher difficulty. I want to target heavy users.
M5290_S0030_G0050_001_robocreator=So with that said, could you bring me a "Five-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0030_G0051_001_robocreator=I want to make an interesting game and become a first-class creator... I want to become one so badly!
M5290_S0030_G0052_001_robocreator=So, could you bring a "Five-color Cable" to me, filled with such enthusiasm?
M5290_S0030_G0060_001_sele=I'll bring it.
M5290_S0030_G0070_001_sele=I won't bring it.
M5290_S0030_G0080_001_robocreator=Spasibo! Well then, counting on you for the "Five-color Cable."
M5290_S0030_G0090_001_robocreator=You can harvest it from Machine Lifeforms in the desert.
M5290_S0030_G0091_300_robocreator=They are mixed in with the group, so do your best to search for them!
M5290_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Harvest... aren't they your comrades?
M5290_S0030_G0110_001_robocreator=Long live Creation!
M5290_S0030_G0120_001_robocreator=I want to make a difficult game for heavy users, so could you bring me a "Five-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0030_G0130_001_robocreator=The "Five-color Cable" is held by Machine Lifeforms in the desert.
M5290_S0030_G0131_300_robocreator=They are mixed in with the group, so do your best to search for them!
M5290_S0040_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! That's a "Five-color Cable." Will you give that to me?
M5290_S0040_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, wait just a moment. Connect this...
M5290_S0040_G0020_001_robocreator=Good! It's become a difficulty where I doubt you can even debug it!
M5290_S0040_G0030_001_robocreator=There's a reward if you find a bug, so try playing iiiit.
M5290_S0040_G0031_001_robocreator=Fufufu... wasn't it difficult?
M5290_S0040_G0032_001_robocreator=Even though it was hard, thanks for finding the bug!
M5290_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=You don't need to make the next game?
M5290_S0040_G0070_001_robocreator=Uugh... Actually, I'm out of ideas.
M5290_S0040_G0080_001_robocreator=I have realized that Creation is not that simple...
M5290_S0040_G0090_001_robocreator=So with that said, I will retire.
M5290_S0040_G0100_001_robocreator=Thank you very much.
M5920_S0020_G0240_001_pod153=Requested materials obtained.
