M6010_S0090_G0320_300_ys=...Ah, wait a sec, 2B is here...
M6010_S0090_G0330_300_ys=C'mon, you have stuff to do, right? Go on, shoo.
M6010_S0090_G0340_300_ys=...I've figured her out. I just let her say everything, then only ask about the parts I don't understand. It's the best way.
M6010_S0090_G0350_300_ys=Her explanations are exhaustive, so it's more efficient that way.
M6010_S0090_G0370_300_ys=I figured it out! For some reason, my sensory settings were recognizing the operator-san's voice as noise!
M6010_S0090_G0380_300_ys=That's why it was so hard to hear and I couldn't understand anything! But I fixed it, so it's okay now!
M6010_S0090_G0390_300_ys=I think we'll be able to work well together from now on!
M6010_S0090_G0400_300_op=She's been much more receptive lately, which has made my job a lot easier.
M6010_S0090_G0410_300_op=I've thought this for a while, but she can do it if she puts her mind to it.
M6010_S0090_G0420_300_op=*Sigh*... She told me she was treating my voice as noise until now... Well, she says it's fine now, so I guess it's okay.
M6010_S0090_G0430_300_op=She's a good kid at heart, so I'll just have to be patient with her.
M6010_S0090_G0440_300_ys=In the end, Eve was defeated before I could even deploy once... I have mixed feelings about it.
M6010_S0090_G0450_300_ys=Anyway, well, thanks.
M6010_S0090_G0460_300_op=If he were in perfect condition, Eve or anyone else would have been a one-hit kill... but oh well, all's well that ends well!
M6010_S0090_G0470_300_op=I'll make sure he's properly tuned up and ready for the next deployment!
M6010_S0090_G0520_300_ys=Listen up, you lot! Burn the battle data from 2B and 9S into your minds!
M6010_S0090_G0530_300_ys=With this, we are invincible! Exterminate the Machine Lifeforms!
M6010_S0090_G0540_300_ys=We won't let your battle data go to waste!
M6010_S0090_G0550_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0090_G0560_300_ys=You two are amazing, but... I don't think I can do that...
M6010_S0090_G0570_300_ys=...But, well, I guess I'll try a little harder.
M6010_S0090_G0580_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0590_300_ys=It's not the captain's battle data, huh. Oh well, it'll be a good reference.
M6010_S0090_G0600_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0610_300_op=I feel like this team has grown a little. It might be time for them to leave the nest.
M6010_S0090_G0620_300_op=This team will be fine now.
M6010_S0100_G0320_300_ys=...Sorry, something came up...
M6010_S0100_G0330_300_ys=I'll catch up later. Don't worry about me, go on ahead.
M6010_S0100_G0340_300_ys=Time to deploy.
M6010_S0100_G0350_300_ys=I've memorized the plan perfectly. All that's left is to do it.
M6010_S0100_G0360_300_ys=Let's both do our best.
M6010_S0100_G0370_300_ys=Thanks to my operator, the plan is perfect!
M6010_S0100_G0380_300_op=I've done all I can. The rest is up to her.
M6010_S0100_G0390_300_op=Objectively speaking, I think we make a good team.
M6010_S0100_G0400_300_op=I've given her all the information I have. She should be able to do it.
M6010_S0100_G0410_300_op=I'm looking forward to seeing what she can do.
M6010_S0100_G0420_300_ys=What the hell!? I can't deploy yet!? Hurry! Tune me up already!
M6010_S0100_G0430_300_op=Hmm, these numbers aren't looking good...
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0470_300_ys=Listen up, you lot! Show me the results of your training!
M6010_S0100_G0480_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0490_300_ys=We'll make good use of your battle data.
M6010_S0100_G0500_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0510_300_ys=...The captain's taken care of me, so I'll give it my all.
M6010_S0100_G0520_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0530_300_ys=Alright, time to show them what I've got!
M6010_S0100_G0540_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0550_300_op=All we can do now is pray.
M6010_S0100_G0560_300_op=Glory to Mankind.
