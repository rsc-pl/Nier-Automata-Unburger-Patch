M1090_S0120_G0000_101_ane=2B!
M1090_S0120_G0010_101_a2b=Are you alright?
M1090_S0120_G0020_101_ane=They just swarmed the camp out of nowhere...
M1090_S0120_G0030_101_ane=We tried to fight back, but our guns don't work on them!
M1090_S0120_G0040_101_pod042=Alert: Energy shields confirmed on enemy units.
M1090_S0120_G0050_101_pod042=Proposal: Engage with close-range physical attacks.
M1090_S0120_G0060_101_a2b=Got it. You get the other androids to safety!
M1090_S0120_G0070_101_ane=I'm counting on you!
M1090_S0120_G0080_101_ane=Thanks, 2B. You really saved us...
M1090_S0120_G0090_101_a2b=What's going on?
M1090_S0120_G0100_101_ane=I have no idea. They just appeared out of nowhere and attacked—
M1090_S0120_G0110_101_a2b=What!?
M1090_S0120_G0120_101_ane=That came from outside the camp!
