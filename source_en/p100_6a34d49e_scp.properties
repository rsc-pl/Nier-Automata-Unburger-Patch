M0010_S0220_G0110_101_a9s=2B-san. I... am happy.
M0010_S0220_G0120_101_a2b=About what?
M0010_S0220_G0130_101_a9s=We Scanner types usually do preliminary investigations alone.
M0010_S0220_G0140_101_a9s=So, getting to work with someone else is... fun.
M0010_S0220_G0150_101_a2b=...Possessing emotions is prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G0160_101_a9s=Ah... I'm sorry!
M0010_S0220_G0170_101_a2b=Also...
M0010_S0220_G0180_101_a2b=You don't need to add "-san".
M0010_S0220_G0190_101_a9s=...Eh?
M0010_S0220_G0200_101_a2b=Honorifics are unnecessary for my name.
M0010_S0220_G0210_101_a9s=...Understood. 2B!
M0010_S0220_G0220_101_a2b=It is vast... this ruin.
M0010_S0220_G0230_101_a9s=Apparently, this place used to be a weapons factory for humanity long ago.
M0010_S0220_G0240_101_a9s=Though now, it's completely full of Machine Lifeforms...
M0010_S0220_G0250_101_a9s=It seems the enemy is reusing this factory to mass-produce Machine Lifeforms.
M0010_S0220_G0260_101_a2b=They'll spawn infinitely unless we annihilate them...
M0010_S0220_G0266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G0267_101_a9s=It's using data from the Old World to speak random things.
M0010_S0220_G0268_101_a9s=There's no meaning to what Machine Lifeforms do.
