M5222_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2-san.
M5222_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=Thank you again for the matter with the playground. I am truly grateful...
M5222_S0010_G0020_001_pascal=Those children are, to me...
M5222_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=No, they are a treasure to this village, and the hope for our future.
M5222_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=Do you think it's strange for us Machine Lifeforms to speak of the future?
M5222_S0010_G0050_001_a2=...Who knows.
M5222_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=I'm sure those children won't lose to this barren conflict, and will carve out a new path for themselves.
M5222_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=That's what I believe. But...
M5222_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=Actually, among the village children, there is one whose memory element is in poor condition.
M5222_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=At this rate, that child will...
M5222_S0010_G0100_001_a2=Then why not just repair it?
M5222_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=The thing is, we're lacking the necessary materials.
M5222_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Those materials can only be obtained at the factory ruins, but there are many ferocious Machine Lifeforms there...
M5222_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=I thought, if it's A2-san... and so I am swallowing my shame to ask this of you.
M5222_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Lend a hand.
M5222_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Refuse.
M5222_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=I see... Well, if your circumstances happen to change, please keep it in mind.
M5222_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=To repair the village child, we need materials.
M5222_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Could you please lend us a hand?
M5222_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=Thank you so much!
M5222_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=The necessary materials are in the factory ruins, so please, I am counting on you.
M5222_S0010_G0210_001_pascal=The materials needed for the child's repair are in the factory ruins.
M5222_S0010_G0220_001_pascal=I know it's a great deal of trouble, but I'm counting on you.
M5222_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Destruction of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5222_S0020_G0010_001_a2=Is this the memory element material Pascal wanted?
M5222_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Killing other Machine Lifeforms to protect a Machine Lifeform child...
M5222_S0020_G0030_001_a2=...
M5222_S0020_G0040_001_a2=Let's deliver the materials to Pascal.
M5222_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=Ah! A2-san. You've gathered the materials to repair the child.
M5222_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=Thank you very much.
M5222_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=This isn't nearly enough, I know, but please take it as a token of my thanks...
M5222_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=...Truthfully, without going to the trouble of repairing her, we could just transfer her core to a new body.
M5222_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=If we did that, we could come back to life any number of times.
M5222_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=However... her memories would be lost.
M5222_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=And I feel that... it would no longer be the same child.
M5222_S0030_G0070_001_pascal=Truly, thank you so very much!
