M5562_S0030_G0250_001_ppl=Oh, right. I made alcohol from Desert Roses again.
M5562_S0030_G0260_001_ppl=If you'd like, please take some.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Come to think of it, to repair and adjust weapons, you need a weapon to serve as the prototype base, right? How do you get them in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=Come to think of it, how do you get the prototype materials for making weapons in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=Come to think of it, how do you get the prototype materials for making weapons in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Ah, the owner of this shop sends them.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=A woman named "Accord" is the manager here. I'm just watching the shop and helping with maintenance.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=Even though I say manager, she only wanders back once every few years. Usually she just sends weapons via delivery drone.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=I don't know where she gets them, but many of the weapons are in good condition.
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=If you happen to meet her while you're out, give her my regards.
M6010_S0010_G0000_001_ane=...You've changed, Number Two. Your tone, your personality, it's completely different from that time.
M6010_S0010_G0010_001_a2=Likewise. Anemone has become leader-like.
M6010_S0010_G0020_001_ane=Me? Compared to Rose, I'm...
M6010_S0010_G0030_001_ane=......
M6010_S0010_G0040_001_ane=...Actually, the records of that time are saved on that external storage over there.
M6010_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I thought that the events of that day, when we fought, had to be preserved.
M6010_S0010_G0060_001_ane=And, you have the right to know them.
M6010_S0010_G0070_001_a2=......
M6010_S0010_G0080_001_ane=We are the only ones who must not forget.
M6010_S0010_G0090_001_a2=...Yeah.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How is your condition? Don't be too reckless.
M6090_S0010_G0010_300_ane=If you have free time, I want you to help those who are in trouble.
M6090_S0010_G0020_300_kj=Hey. Leave weapon maintenance to me anytime.
M6090_S0010_G0030_300_kj=Need weapons?
M6090_S0010_G0040_300_kj=Come again!
M6090_S0010_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. Buying something?
M6090_S0010_G0060_300_toolshop=Buying something?
M6090_S0010_G0070_300_toolshop=Come again!
M6090_S0010_G0810_300_ys=If you want to listen to something too, feel free to change it to a song you like.
M6090_S0010_G0820_300_ys=I like calm songs because they're soothing, but intense songs are good too since they heighten the will to fight.
M6090_S0010_G0830_300_bs=Hello. You are YoRHa people, right?
M6090_S0010_G0840_300_bs=This is the Maintenance Shop. We handle consultation and maintenance for everyone's bodies.
M6090_S0010_G0850_300_bs=Is there something you need?
M6090_S0010_G0860_300_bs=If you adjust your body, you can advance combat advantageously.
M6090_S0010_G0870_300_bs=If you obtain new chips or programs, by all means please try them out.
M6090_S0010_G0880_300_bs=Are you here for maintenance?
M6090_S0010_G0890_300_bs=We await your next visit.
M6090_S0010_G0900_300_sele=Perform Strengthening/Synthesis.
M6090_S0010_G0910_300_sele=Consult about body.
M6090_S0010_G0915_300_sele=Nothing in particular.
M6090_S0010_G0920_300_bs=What shall we talk about?
M6090_S0010_G0930_300_sele=About bodies.
M6090_S0010_G0940_300_sele=About Pod strengthening.
M6090_S0010_G0950_300_sele=About additional Pod acquisition.
M6090_S0010_G0960_300_sele=About weapon equipment.
M6090_S0010_G0970_300_sele=I get 3D motion sickness...
M6090_S0010_G0975_300_sele=Return.
M6090_S0010_G0990_300_bs=A body refers to the physical bodies of you YoRHa troops yourselves.
M6090_S0010_G1000_300_bs=To strengthen a body, there are two types: "Experience Value" and "Plug-in Chips."
M6090_S0010_G1010_300_bs=Experience Value... is famous so I don't need to explain it, right?
M6090_S0010_G1020_300_bs=Plug-in Chips are items that strengthen the main unit, and they have various functions.
M6090_S0010_G1030_300_bs=However, the operation is difficult, and if you try to set it yourself, the hurdle is quite high...
M6090_S0010_G1040_300_bs=If you'd like, shall I set the chips you have now to my recommended settings?
M6090_S0010_G1050_300_sele=Yes.
M6090_S0010_G1060_300_sele=No.
M6090_S0010_G1070_300_bs=Which type shall I set it to?
M6090_S0010_G1080_300_sele=Balance focused.
M6090_S0010_G1090_300_sele=Attack focused.
M6090_S0010_G1100_300_sele=Defense focused.
M6090_S0010_G1105_300_sele=Do not adjust.
M6090_S0010_G1110_300_bs=Understood. I will set it for you.
M6090_S0010_G1120_300_bs=Yes. It is complete.
M6090_S0010_G1130_300_bs=Plug-in Chips are deep, so if you are interested, please try setting them yourself.
M6090_S0010_G1140_300_bs=Pods are Accompanying Support Units supplied to the YoRHa troops, but there are two ways to strengthen them.
M6090_S0010_G1150_300_bs=First is the method of strengthening at a maintenance shop like ours.
M6090_S0010_G1155_300_bs=Money and materials are required, but you can strengthen the Pod's attack power.
M6090_S0010_G1160_300_bs=The other method is equipping "Pod Programs."
M6090_S0010_G1170_300_bs=Pod Programs exist in various types, from attack types like lasers to support types that obstruct enemy actions.
M6090_S0010_G1180_300_bs=We sell them here too, so if you are interested, please buy them.
M6090_S0010_G1190_300_bs=It seems multiple Pods can be equipped... but Pods themselves are rare items, so shops don't sell them.
M6090_S0010_G1200_300_bs=If you can find them somewhere, I think usability will improve...
M6090_S0010_G1210_300_bs=I hear information like "fallen somewhere in the desert" or "dropped in the sea," but...
M6090_S0010_G1220_300_bs=The latest YoRHa units can equip weapons via "WEAPON" in the system menu launched with <KC_MENU>.
M6090_S0010_G1230_300_bs=You can set up to 2 sets of 2 types of weapons, so please try various things.
M6090_S0010_G1240_300_bs=Switching sets can be done from the <KC_SHORTCUT> shortcut menu.
M6090_S0010_G1250_300_bs=Is that so...
M6090_S0010_G1255_300_bs=Various settings are possible in <KC_MENU> System Menu -> "SYSTEM" -> "Options" -> "Camera", so please set it to your preferred state there.
M6090_S0010_G1260_300_bs=It is also possible for me to adjust the camera, what shall I do?
M6090_S0010_G1270_300_sele=Set camera to minimize 3D motion sickness.
M6090_S0010_G1280_300_sele=Return to normal camera settings.
M6090_S0010_G1290_300_sele=No need to adjust.
M6090_S0010_G1300_300_bs=Understood. Then, I will set the camera here.
M6090_S0010_G1310_300_bs=Adjustment complete. Please handle fine adjustments yourself.
M6090_S0010_G1320_300_bs=Understood.
M6090_S0020_G0000_300_ane=You made it back. If there is anything you lack, you should resupply.
M6090_S0020_G0010_300_ane=You must be tired. Please rest your body leisurely.
M6090_S0020_G0020_300_kj=Various things are tough, but attack power is most important for fighting. Make sure you maintain your weapons properly.
M6090_S0020_G0030_300_kj=Oh, need weapons?
M6090_S0020_G0040_300_kj=Come again!
M6090_S0020_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. We have good stuff!
M6090_S0020_G0060_300_toolshop=Looking at something?
M6090_S0020_G0070_300_toolshop=Come again!
M6090_S0020_G0770_300_dbl=Welcome. Is there anything you lack?
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, looking for something?
M6090_S0020_G0790_300_dbl=Do your best.
M6090_S0020_G0800_300_ppl=Welcome. Is there anything you lack?
M6090_S0020_G0810_300_ppl=Oh, what do you need?
M6090_S0020_G0820_300_ppl=I'm rooting for you.
M6090_S0020_G0830_300_ys=Good work. Did you come to listen to something too?
M6090_S0020_G0840_300_ys=Humans of the past also seemed to gather in places with music. ...Just like us.
M6090_S0030_G0000_300_ane=Welcome back. I'm glad you returned safely.
M6090_S0030_G0010_300_ane=Is there anything you lack? Outside is dangerous... do not let your guard down.
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=Purchased weapons can also be strengthened here.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=Money and strengthening materials are required, but they will become strong enough to be worth it. Also, depending on the weapon, some gain special abilities.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=If you feel like it, give it a try.
M6090_S0030_G0020_300_kj=That was rough... You need weapons, right? Look around leisurely.
M6090_S0030_G0021_300_kj=You... That weapon is...
M6090_S0030_G0022_300_kj=I see. That girl died...
M6090_S0030_G0023_300_kj=YoRHa troops' weapons preserve the wielder's external memory. Please cherish the abilities... and memories she held.
M6090_S0030_G0030_300_kj=What do you need?
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Alright, with this, I've forged this weapon to Lv.3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=This is as far as we can do here but... apparently there is a master craftsman in this world who forges up to Lv.4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If such a guy exists, I'd like him to become my master.
M6090_S0030_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. No matter what happens, I'll back you up with full power!
M6090_S0030_G0060_300_toolshop=If there's anything you need, say anything.
M6090_S0030_G0070_300_toolshop=Come again!
M6090_S0030_G0300_300_dbl=Welcome back. Is there anything you lack?
M6090_S0030_G0310_300_dbl=It's dangerous lately. Prepare yourself properly before you go.
M6090_S0030_G0320_300_dbl=Be careful.
M6090_S0030_G0330_300_ppl=Welcome back. Is there anything you lack?
M6090_S0030_G0340_300_ppl=I think it's difficult but... you must prepare properly.
M6090_S0030_G0350_300_ppl=Be careful.
M6090_S0040_G0000_300_ane=You guys... Did the Large-Scale Weapon coordinate data arrive?
M6090_S0040_G0010_300_ane=To think two weapons of that magnitude appeared... You guys be careful too.
M6090_S0040_G0020_300_ane=If a place like this is fine, rest as much as you like. Sorry I can only do this much...
M6090_S0050_G0000_300_ane=It seems quite a few androids went missing in this operation.
M6090_S0050_G0010_300_ane=We have also formed a search party, but we can't get close to the danger zones... The rescue operation is facing difficulties.
M6090_S0050_G0020_300_ane=I understand the feeling of impatience, but it would be terrible if something happened to you too. Prepare yourself thoroughly.
M6090_S0060_G0000_300_ane=For such a thing to... Everyone is... There must be comrades who evacuated, even just a few...
M6090_S0060_G0010_300_ane=...Sorry, right now this is all I can resupply...
M6090_S0070_G0000_300_ane=Are you injured?
M6090_S0070_G0010_300_ane=We are also... not exactly back to normal, but preparations to support are complete.
M6090_S0070_G0020_300_ane=If there is anything necessary, please resupply.
M6090_S0070_G0030_300_ane=With this, everything will be settled... ...Glory to Mankind.
M6090_S0120_G0000_300_ys=Listening to music calms me down... You think so too, right?
M6090_S0120_G0010_300_sele=I think so.
M6090_S0120_G0020_300_sele=I don't think so.
M6090_S0120_G0030_300_ys=Looks like we'll get along. Alright, I'll give you this.
M6090_S0120_G0040_300_ys=This is a box called a Jukebox in the past, a machine that plays music.
M6090_S0120_G0050_300_ys=If you have records, you can play music you like. Use it freely.
M6090_S0120_G0060_300_ys=I see, that's a shame.
