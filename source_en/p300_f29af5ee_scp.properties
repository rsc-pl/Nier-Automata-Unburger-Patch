M3020_S0026_G0020_001_pod153=Report: Regarding the giant structure accessed earlier.
M3020_S0026_G0030_001_pod153=It is thought to stem from Machine Lifeforms, but details are unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0040_001_pod153=Additionally, it has been determined that large units launched from the structure exist in several locations.
M3020_S0026_G0050_001_a9s=Large units?
M3020_S0026_G0060_001_pod153=The objects marked as destinations earlier; predicted to be the self-proclaimed "Resource Recovery Units."
M3020_S0026_G0070_001_a9s=What is the units' objective?
M3020_S0026_G0080_001_pod153=Unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0090_001_a9s=...Where is A2?
M3020_S0026_G0100_001_pod153=Current location and life signs both unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0110_001_a9s=Understood...

M3020_S0026_G0140_001_a9s=Extermination of Machine Lifeforms.
M3020_S0026_G0150_001_pod153=Now that the YoRHa unit base Bunker has been destroyed, it is judged that orders for each unit member are reserved.
M3020_S0026_G0160_001_pod153=Recommendation: Rendezvous with Resistance forces and reconfirmation of command chain.
M3020_S0026_G0170_001_a9s=...I'm not doing it because it's an order.
M3020_S0026_G0180_001_a9s=I decided it.
M3020_S0026_G0190_001_a9s=I will exterminate the Machine Lifeforms.
M3020_S0026_G0200_001_a9s=And then...
M3020_S0026_G0210_001_a9s=I will kill... A2.
M3020_S0026_G0220_300_pod153=Recommendation: Investigation of marked Resource Recovery Units.
M3020_S0026_G0230_300_a9s=I know.
M3020_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Is that... the large unit?
M3020_S0040_G0010_001_pod153=Affirmative.
M3020_S0040_G0020_001_pod153=It appears to be sending something out to the giant structure.
M3020_S0040_G0030_001_pod153=Speculation: A facility sending out some kind of resource to the giant structure.
M3020_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=Sending out... what?
M3020_S0040_G0050_001_pod153=Unknown.
M3020_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=For what purpose?
M3020_S0040_G0070_001_pod153=Unknown.
M5920_S0130_G0000_001_a9s=Fog...?
M5920_S0130_G0010_001_pod153=Report: Confirmed generation of massive amounts of steam from enemy large unit.
M5920_S0130_G0020_001_a9s=Steam? ...What in the world for...
