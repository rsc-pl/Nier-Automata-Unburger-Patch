M5250_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Oh, 9S-san. Is something the matter?
M5250_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=There's something I wanted to ask...
M5250_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Ask about pacifism.
M5250_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Ask about life in the village.
M5250_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Ask about the shops.
M5250_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=Ah... Our reason for hating conflict?
M5250_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=It is difficult to say in a single word, but essentially, I suppose we have lost the meaning of fighting.
M5250_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=...I don't really get it.
M5250_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=We are weapons created to wage war. However, the war has continued for too long.
M5250_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=We realized that the sum of individual disadvantages had become greater than the benefits brought by victory in war.
M5250_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=I believe a day will come when Androids and Machine Lifeforms will conclude a peace treaty.
M5250_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=...That's impossible.
M5250_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Our daily life... is it?
M5250_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=As you can see, we are machines and do not require food. The cores driving us supply energy semi-permanently.
M5250_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=However, since we are machines, we break down over time. Repairing and replacing parts is our daily routine.
M5250_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=That said, we do not break frequently, so we live a leisurely life.
M5250_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Why are there shops in Pascal's village? You shouldn't have any money, right?
M5250_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=No, we utilize simple materials as a substitute for money.
M5250_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Since we are all equal, the previous systems of collection and distribution did not suit us, so we tried creating an economic society based on exchange.
M5250_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=We learned this from the past records of humanity. I think it is an interesting system.
M5250_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=We are also having our children learn about currency and economics. If you like, please listen to what the children have to say.
M5250_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Sounds fun. What are you doing?
M5250_S0010_G0220_001_robochildrenA=Hey hey, this guy is weird!
M5250_S0010_G0230_001_robochildrenB=When you ask him "Which do you want, a high value coin or a cheap coin?", he says he wants the cheap coin!
M5250_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=Hoh...
M5250_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=Say, which do you want? The high value coin or the cheap coin?
M5250_S0010_G0260_001_robostrange=Ummmmm, the cheap coin!
M5250_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=Are you sure you're okay with this one?
M5250_S0010_G0280_001_robostrange=This one is cooooler. Ehehe, thaaaanks.
M5250_S0010_G0290_001_robochildrenA=See? He's weird, right?
M5250_S0010_G0300_001_robochildrenB=You call this kind of thing an idiot!
M5250_S0010_G0310_001_robostrange=Idiot? Me idiot? Ehehe, thaaaanks.
M5250_S0010_G0320_001_a9s=...Is there a problem with his calculation circuits? Or is the thought circuit itself strange?
M5250_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=...I'll take a little peek inside.
M5250_S0010_G0340_001_a9s=What is this? It's more complex than I expected... One more time.
M5250_S0010_G0350_001_a9s=...You are...
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=...
M5250_S0010_G0370_001_a9s=While possessing such high-level thought circuits, why?
M5250_S0010_G0380_001_robostrange=Good grief, so I've been found out.
M5250_S0010_G0390_001_robostrange=The answer is simple. If I say I prefer the cheap coin over the expensive coin, those around me find it amusing and give it to me over and over. Right?
M5250_S0010_G0400_001_robostrange=As a result, I can obtain a larger amount of money than with the expensive coin. No, I've made quite a profit.
M5250_S0010_G0410_001_robostrange=Listen well. Letting them think you are a fool brings you closer to the truth. Remember that.
M5250_S0010_G0420_001_robostrange=Ah, keep this a secret. I still need them to think I'm an idiot.
M5250_S0010_G0430_001_robostrange=This is hush money.
M5250_S0010_G0440_001_a9s=I wonder what being smart actually means...
M5250_S0010_G0450_001_pod153=Answer Impossible: Because the definition of the question is ambiguous.
M5250_S0010_G0460_001_a9s=I guess so.
