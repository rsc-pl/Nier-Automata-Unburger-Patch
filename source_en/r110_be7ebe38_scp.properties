M4020_S0000_G0060_300_a9s=It's pretty spacious, isn't it?\nIs it really okay for us to get a room like this?
M4020_S0000_G0070_300_a2b=The Leader gave us permission, so it should be fine.\nThe mission on the surface is looking like it'll be a long one, so being able to rest in a bed is a big help.
M4020_S0000_G0070_300_a9s=You're right. Let's make good use of it.
M4020_S0000_G0080_300_a9s=Haaah... I'm beat.
M4020_S0000_G0090_300_a2b=...We're leaving as soon as we've had a short rest.
M4020_S0000_G0100_300_a9s=Okaay.
M4020_S0000_G0110_300_a9s=Having a place to come back to is the best.
M4020_S0000_G0120_300_a2b=What's this all of a sudden?
M4020_S0000_G0130_300_a9s=No reason. I think I get why humans built houses and settled down, though... just a little.
M4020_S0000_G0140_300_a2b=You have your own room assigned to you on the Bunker, too.
M4020_S0000_G0150_300_a9s=Mmm... I can't ever really relax on the Bunker, somehow.
M4020_S0000_G0160_300_a9s=Want to take a little break?
M4020_S0000_G0170_300_a2b=All right...
M4020_S0000_G0180_300_a2b=Let's rest for a bit.
M4020_S0000_G0190_300_a9s=Sounds good.
M5140_S0020_G0050_300_a2b=It won't open...
M5140_S0020_G0060_300_a9s=It won't open...
M6010_S0110_G0010_300_pod042=Rest?
