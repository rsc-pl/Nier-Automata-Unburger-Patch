M5101_S0010_G0010_001_robomaster=Using the last parts, I have grown even stronger, ye know?
M5101_S0010_G0020_001_robomaster=Perfect timing. How about it? Will ye let me test the results of my modifications?
M5101_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Accompany him to test the results.
M5101_S0010_G0030_300_robomaster=Do ye wish me to accompany ye in training?
M5101_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Do not accompany him to test the results.
M5101_S0010_G0040_300_sele=Resume training.
M5101_S0010_G0050_001_robomaster=I am a far cry from the me of before!
M5101_S0010_G0050_300_sele=Do not resume training.
M5101_S0010_G0060_001_robomaster=A pity... If ye change yer mind, come again.
M5101_S0010_G0060_300_robomaster=In thy weakened state, ye are no match. Come back when ye are ready.
M5101_S0010_G0070_001_robomaster=Oh... Have I become this strong...!
M5101_S0010_G0080_001_robomaster=Ho ho ho. If ye like, shall I accompany ye in training again?

M5101_S0010_G0090_001_robomaster=I yield! I am beaten! That is enough!
M5101_S0010_G0090_300_sele=Give Items
M5101_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Phew... Are you satisfied now?
M5101_S0010_G0100_300_sele=Do not give Items
M5101_S0010_G0110_001_robomaster=...
M5101_S0010_G0120_001_robomaster=Now then, about my thanks...
M5101_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Huh? ...No, this wasn't really a lesson...
M5101_S0010_G0140_001_robomaster=Uuh... To not even grant a single wish of this old, decrepit Master.
M5101_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=Don't suddenly start playing the old man.
M5101_S0010_G0160_001_robomaster=Do the young androids of today have no compassion...?
M5101_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=Ugh, how annoying... Fine, I get it!
M5101_S0010_G0180_001_robomaster='Memory Alloy' and a 'Broken Circuit'!
M5101_S0010_G0190_001_robomaster=I'm counting on ye, young'un!
M5101_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=What "young'un," honestly...
M5101_S0010_G0210_001_robomaster=A 'Memory Alloy' and 'Broken Circuit' will suffice as thanks for the bout, ye know?
M5101_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Right. I brought what you asked for.
M5101_S0020_G0000_300_robomaster=Are ye that excited for my evolution? Such an impatient one.
M5101_S0020_G0010_001_robomaster=I am grateful, grateful. With this, I can perform new modifications again!
M5101_S0020_G0020_001_robomaster=By the time ye next arrive, I will have become much, much stronger!
M5101_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Well, I'll... look forward to it. In moderation.
