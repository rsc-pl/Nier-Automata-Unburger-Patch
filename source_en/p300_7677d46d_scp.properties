M3030_S0100_G0000_001_a2=Are you okay, Pascal!?
M3030_S0100_G0010_001_pascal=Ah... A2-san.
M3030_S0100_G0020_001_a2=What on earth happened?
M3030_S0100_G0030_001_pascal=I don't know... Suddenly, some of the villagers began eating their own comrades from the village...
M3030_S0100_G0040_001_pascal=If you hadn't come for us, A2-san, we too would surely have...
M3030_S0100_G0050_001_pascal=Thank you so much.
M3030_S0100_G0060_001_select=Can't you restore your dead comrades?
M3030_S0100_G0070_001_select=Is this factory safe?
M3030_S0100_G0080_001_select=I need a little more information...
M3030_S0100_G0090_001_pod042=Query: Can Machine Lifeforms not be restored, provided the materials are available?
M3030_S0100_G0100_001_pascal=No... You see, we have units called "Cores."
M3030_S0100_G0110_001_pascal=These Cores are the units that form our self-data,
M3030_S0100_G0120_001_pascal=and if they are destroyed, we cannot return to how we were.
M3030_S0100_G0130_001_pascal=We usually store the Cores in a safe place,
M3030_S0100_G0140_001_pascal=but the villagers who were victims this time had their Cores destroyed along with their bodies, so...
M3030_S0100_G0150_001_a2=I see...
M3030_S0100_G0160_001_a2=Is this factory safe?
M3030_S0100_G0170_001_pascal=There used to be berserk Machine Lifeforms living here,
M3030_S0100_G0180_001_pascal=but 2B-san repelled them for us.
M3030_S0100_G0190_001_pascal=It is safe now.
M3030_S0100_G0200_001_pascal=For a while now, we have been using it as a materials storage area.
M3030_S0100_G0210_001_a2=Understood.
M3030_S0110_G0000_001_a2=Even if we're going to hole up here, we need a bit more information...
M3030_S0110_G0010_001_pod042=Recommendation: Secure the safety of Pascal and the others immediately.
M3030_S0110_G0020_001_a2=Don't rush me...
M3030_S0110_G0030_001_pod042=Obtained information from the Pod networks in various regions.
M3030_S0110_G0040_001_a2=You guys have comrades?
M3030_S0110_G0050_001_pod042=Affirmative.
M3030_S0110_G0060_001_pod042=There is information that a large number of Machine Lifeforms are gathering at this factory ruin.
M3030_S0110_G0070_001_a2=What did you say!?
M3030_S0110_G0080_001_a2=Pascal!
M3030_S0110_G0090_001_pascal=Ah... A2-san!
M3030_S0110_G0100_001_pod042=Enemy reinforcement troops commencing intrusion into this facility.
M3030_S0110_G0110_001_a2=I'll crush them before they get into this room!
M3030_S0110_G0120_001_pascal=I-I will provide support, too!!
M3030_S0110_G0121_001_pascal=I will smash them to pieces... and I will murder them!
M5910_S0100_G0155_001_pascal=......
