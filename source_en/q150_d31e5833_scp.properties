M5150_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Don't screw with me, Jackass. I can't go along with your hobbies!
M5150_S0010_G0001_300_jackas=Did you feel like cooperating?
M5150_S0010_G0010_001_jackas=Humph! Stingy!
M5150_S0010_G0011_300_sele=Cooperate.
M5150_S0010_G0020_001_jackas=Ah, it's you guys.
M5150_S0010_G0021_300_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5150_S0010_G0030_001_jackas=That guy, he's stingy... he won't help with my work at all.
M5150_S0010_G0050_001_jackas=Right now, I'm investigating the excitement of androids in a combat state.
M5150_S0010_G0060_001_jackas=So, for the sake of further functional expansion, I want you to let me take the latest model's combat data, but...
M5150_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5150_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5150_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=Good grief, that Jackass...
M5150_S0020_G0000_001_jackas=Really? Thanks!
M5150_S0020_G0001_001_jackas=Then, follow me a bit.
M5150_S0020_G0002_001_jackas=Look, you can see an enemy over there, right?
M5150_S0020_G0003_001_jackas=I want to take data of combat with that thing.
M5150_S0020_G0010_001_jackas=Now then, for the sake of further scientific development... fight!
M5150_S0020_G0030_300_jackas=What's wrong? Don't hold back, keep going!
M5150_S0020_G0040_300_jackas=Oi, what happened? Fight quickly.
M5150_S0020_G0050_300_jackas=Did you get motivated?
M5150_S0020_G0060_300_sele=Yeah
M5150_S0020_G0070_300_sele=No...
M5150_S0020_G0080_300_jackas=Wonderful! Then let's resume!
M5150_S0020_G0090_300_jackas=Is that so... call me again when you get motivated.
M5150_S0020_G0100_300_jackas=It'll take a little time until the drug is ready, so do as you please.
M5150_S0020_G0111_300_jackas=I'd like you to cooperate with the research, but this isn't the time for that, is it...
M5150_S0020_G0121_300_jackas=Come again later!
M5150_S0020_G0130_001_jackas=Un un, wonderful! Thanks to you I got good data, thanks.
M5150_S0020_G0140_001_jackas=Did you know? Excitement in a combat state is very similar to "Love" in humanity's records.
M5150_S0020_G0150_001_jackas=In short, you could say... by fighting, you can simulate the experience of "Love".
M5150_S0020_G0160_001_jackas=Thinking of it that way, combat is quite romantic, isn't it?
M5150_S0020_G0170_001_jackas=...Are, was it a bit too difficult? This won't make for good data. \nI demand a redo!
M5150_S0020_G0180_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out the enemies over there. Will you do it?
M5150_S0020_G0308_001_jackas=There are lots of other things I want to investigate, so call me again anytime.
M5150_S0020_G0309_001_jackas=There are other things I want you to help with~ \nDrop by when you're free.
M5150_S0020_G0310_001_jackas=Oh, you're still full of motivation~ The next battle will be interesting.
M5150_S0020_G0320_001_jackas=By all means, let me take data!
M5150_S0020_G0330_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out the enemies over there, but \n"You must not take damage even once".
M5150_S0020_G0331_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5150_S0020_G0332_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5150_S0020_G0340_001_jackas=Is that so, thanks! Now then, for the sake of further scientific development... \nFight!
M5150_S0020_G0350_001_jackas=No, as expected of the YoRHa squadron. I got data beyond my expectations!
M5150_S0020_G0360_001_jackas=By the way, you YoRHa are specialized for combat, but it seems you think normally.
M5150_S0020_G0370_001_jackas=No, see, I thought if you were a model specialized for combat, normal thinking would just be a hindrance.
M5150_S0020_G0380_001_jackas=Rather, I think it's a useless function.
M5150_S0020_G0400_001_a2b=...
M5150_S0020_G0430_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out the enemies over there, but \n"You must not take damage even once"... can you do it?
M5150_S0020_G0440_001_jackas=You guys! The next battle is tough.
M5150_S0020_G0441_001_jackas=Ooh, you'll challenge it again? Nice. \nYour motivation is overflowing!
M5150_S0020_G0445_001_jackas=I want you to annihilate the enemies over there "within 30 seconds".
M5150_S0020_G0450_001_jackas=By all means, let me take data!
M5150_S0020_G0460_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5150_S0020_G0470_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5150_S0020_G0480_001_jackas=Is that so, thanks! Now then, for the sake of further scientific development... \nFight!
M5150_S0020_G0490_001_jackas=Thanks to you guys, I got interesting data. Look at this!
M5150_S0020_G0500_001_jackas=Here, this reaction. It seems an algorithm to "Find joy in combat" is assembled within the android's circuits.
M5150_S0020_G0510_001_jackas=Well, if it wasn't, you couldn't keep fighting, could you. \nTruly efficient and wonderful!
M5150_S0020_G0520_001_jackas=Maybe it mimicked humanity... if so, how magnificent humans are!
M5150_S0020_G0530_001_jackas=Yes, no good. No good no good. Next time please do it seriously.
M5150_S0020_G0535_001_jackas=I want you to annihilate the enemies over there "within 30 seconds".
M5150_S0020_G0540_001_jackas=The next battle is the last data collection.
M5150_S0020_G0545_001_jackas=I want you to annihilate the enemies "within 30 seconds" while "not taking damage even once".
M5150_S0020_G0550_001_jackas=By all means, cooperate!
M5150_S0020_G0580_001_jackas=Is that so, thanks! Now then, for the sake of further scientific development... \nFight!
M5150_S0020_G0590_001_jackas=Listen to this! Continuing from last time, I found out something truly interesting.
M5150_S0020_G0600_001_jackas=Regarding android excitement in a combat state, it's been confirmed that a component similar to a certain pleasure substance is generated within the circuits.
M5150_S0020_G0610_001_jackas=If I utilize this, I might be able to develop a new drug for function expansion.
M5150_S0020_G0620_001_jackas=This and that, it's all thanks to you guys cooperating.
M5150_S0020_G0630_001_jackas=Thanks! Look forward to the drug being finished.
M5150_S0020_G0640_001_jackas=To come this far and get this result... \nI'd like you to tackle everything with full power.
M5150_S0020_G0645_001_jackas=Annihilate the enemies "within 30 seconds" while "not taking damage even once"... \nCan you do it?
M5150_S0030_G0000_001_jackas=Ya, you guys! Did you come to test the drug?
M5150_S0030_G0010_001_jackas=This has a good reputation again. Seems once you use it you can't stop.
M5150_S0030_G0020_001_jackas=Your comrades have taken a liking to it too.
M5150_S0030_G0030_001_jackas=Well, the mind becomes a little unstable as a side effect but...
M5150_S0030_G0040_001_jackas=For a model specialized in combat, it shouldn't be a problem.
M5150_S0030_G0050_001_jackas=I'll give it to you guys who helped me as a service, so try it out.
M5150_S0030_G0071_001_jackas=If you want more drugs, you should visit the YoRHa squadron member at the oil field deep in the desert.
M5150_S0030_G0072_001_jackas=She asked for the recipe, so she's surely making it herself.
M5150_S0040_G0000_300_jackas=Hmmm, I still don't have enough data... \nYou, won't you cooperate a little more?
M5150_S0040_G0010_300_jackas=More... I want more data...! \nOf course, you'll cooperate, right?
M5150_S0040_G0020_300_jackas=Just a little more, there's missing data. Cooperate with me.
M5150_S0040_G0030_300_sele=Cooperate
M5150_S0040_G0040_300_sele=Another time
M5150_S0040_G0050_300_jackas=That's how it should be.
M5150_S0040_G0070_300_jackas=Alright, here we go! You're the best! \nThis is the last data collection.
M5150_S0040_G0075_300_jackas=Now then, for the sake of further scientific development... fight!
M5150_S0040_G0100_300_jackas=This is something I can only ask of you. You know that, right?
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Mail reception notification from Access Point.
M5920_S0010_G0250_001_pod042=Requested objective achieved.
