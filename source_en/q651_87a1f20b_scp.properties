M5650_S0020_G0010_300_sele=Guess I have no choice.
M5650_S0020_G0020_300_sele=I'm busy right now.
M5650_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=I'm counting on you!
M5650_S0020_G0040_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside once to refresh mood.
M5650_S0020_G0050_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside once to refresh mood.
M5650_S0020_G0051_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside and deliver cargo to requester.
M5650_S0020_G0052_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside and deliver cargo to requester.

M5650_S0020_G0070_300_sele=Continue work.
M5651_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, it's you. Long time no see...
M5651_S0010_G0010_001_resiman=Actually, I can't get the "Cargo for Transport" out again... um...
M5651_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=Please! Help me!
M5651_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=You are... a former YoRHa member?
M5651_S0010_G0040_001_resiman=Just in time. Actually, the "Cargo for Transport" is heavy and I can't get it out... um...
M5651_S0010_G0050_001_resiman=Please! Help me!
M5651_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Help.
M5651_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Refuse.
M5651_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=Ugh... I see... I'm going to get yelled at by Senpai again...
M5651_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=Ah! Are you possibly in the mood to go get the cargo!?
M5651_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=Eh! Really!?
M5651_S0010_G0110_001_resiman=Man, that saves me... That Senpai is really scary...
M5651_S0010_G0120_001_resiman=It would really save me if you gathered the "Cargo for Transport."
M5651_S0020_G0000_001_pod153=Marking objects thought to be "Cargo for Transport".
M5651_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Marking objects thought to be "Cargo for Transport".
M5651_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=With this, I've finished gathering all the cargo...
M5651_S0020_G0050_001_a2=With this, I've finished gathering all the cargo...
M5651_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, you gathered the cargo. Thank you! You saved me!
M5651_S0030_G0010_001_resiman=The warehouse was in a terrible state, right? ...Actually, Senpai wandered in a while ago and scattered things around.
M5651_S0030_G0020_001_resiman=I'm always made to clean up the mess...
M5651_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=Ah, this is a thank you. Please accept it.
