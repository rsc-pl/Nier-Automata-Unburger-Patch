M5550_S0010_G0000_001_ys=You are... an old model YoRHa unit...
M5550_S0010_G0010_001_ys=Well, not that it matters...
M5550_S0010_G0020_001_ys=You are... a YoRHa unit!? You survived?
M5550_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=...Yeah. I'm 9S.
M5550_S0010_G0031_001_ys=I've heard of you... You're the model called Nines, right?
M5550_S0010_G0032_001_a9s=Yes.
M5550_S0010_G0040_001_ys=You did well to survive... I am 4S.
M5550_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=...The Type-4s are models deployed in the early stages, aren't they.
M5550_S0010_G0060_001_4s=I never thought I'd meet a Scanner model...
M5550_S0010_G0070_001_4s=Because the Bunker ended up like *that*.
M5550_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=...What are you doing here?
M5550_S0010_G0090_001_4s=I am gathering intelligence on the enemy.
M5550_S0010_G0100_001_4s=The YoRHa squadron has been annihilated, but the Resistance is still surviving, after all.
M5550_S0010_G0110_001_4s=While this body still moves, I want to be useful to someone...
M5550_S0010_G0120_001_4s=If you possess individual data on enemies, won't you tell me? There are limits to gathering intelligence alone.
M5550_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=...Sure. I'll hand over the data I have on hand.
M5550_S0010_G0135_001_telo=Handed over Enemy Data.
M5550_S0010_G0140_001_4s=Thank you.
M5550_S0010_G0150_001_4s=If you obtain new Enemy Data, please tell me. Let's share information with each other.
M5550_S0010_G0160_001_4s=If you encounter new enemies, I want you to tell me the information.
M5550_S0010_G0170_001_4s=Oh, new enemy data? Thank you.
M5550_S0010_G0180_001_4s=Coming here many times would be a hassle, so I don't mind if you wait until a certain amount of records have accumulated.
M5550_S0020_G0030_001_4s=You gathered Enemy Data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0020_G0040_001_4s=Hmm... Is that so... Hmm...
M5550_S0020_G0050_001_4s=I tried comparing it with the data I collected, but as expected, individual differences have begun appearing in the robots recently.
M5550_S0020_G0060_001_4s=The individual differences seem to vary by region. It's like they are influenced by their environment... It's strange. Even though they are robots.
M5550_S0020_G0070_001_4s=Ah, I must thank you. Please, take this.
M5550_S0020_G0080_001_4s=Come to think of it... Is it okay if I call you Nines, too? Just like the others.
M5550_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=That's fine. Though, there are no "others" left to call me that...
M5550_S0020_G0100_001_4s=I see... I asked something bad.
M5550_S0030_G0020_001_4s=You gathered Enemy Data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0030_G0030_001_4s=I try my best, but I just can't cover all this ground on my own.
M5550_S0030_G0040_001_4s=That's why Nines's cooperation is truly helpful. Thank you.
M5550_S0030_G0045_001_4s=Here, this is my thanks.
M5550_S0030_G0050_001_4s=I'm counting on you to report again if more Enemy Data accumulates.
M5550_S0040_G0020_001_4s=You gathered Enemy Data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0040_G0030_001_4s=Ah, this enemy... It contains data on the guy I fought with my comrades before.
M5550_S0040_G0040_001_4s=In the past, you know, I also had many comrades. But they were done in by that virus contamination.
M5550_S0040_G0050_001_4s=I was injured in the battle just prior and was in a dormant state, so I was safe, but...
M5550_S0040_G0060_001_4s=There are no comrades left anymore.
M5550_S0040_G0070_001_4s=...Sorry. I talked about something strange. Thanks for the data, Nines.
M5550_S0040_G0080_001_4s=I'm counting on you to report again if more Enemy Data accumulates.
M5550_S0050_G0020_001_4s=You gathered Enemy Data for me.
M5550_S0050_G0030_001_4s=Thanks to you, I was able to collect it 60% faster than scheduled. As expected, the same model type is reliable.
M5550_S0050_G0040_001_4s=...I wonder how long we'll continue doing this sort of thing.
M5550_S0050_G0050_001_4s=Even though there is no longer a place for us YoRHa troops to return to...
M5550_S0050_G0060_001_a9s=...Even for us, there should still be things we can do. Intelligence gathering is legitimate combat support.
M5550_S0050_G0070_001_4s=I know. I know that!!
M5550_S0050_G0080_001_4s=...Sorry. It was useless to say that to you, Nines.
M5550_S0050_G0090_001_4s=With this, the goal for Enemy Data collection is cleared. Thank you so much for cooperating.
M5550_S0050_G0100_001_4s=This belonged to a comrade, but will you take it? If you use it, I think everyone would be happy.
M5550_S0050_G0110_001_4s=See you later. You... Nines, please don't ever have regrets.
M5550_S0050_G0120_001_4s=I have to think about what to do from here on out.
M5550_S0050_G0130_001_4s=...Thanks for everything until now.
