M6110_S0010_G0010_001_n02=You beat them all? Congratulations!\nBut, even if you conquer everything, you still can't choose me.
M6110_S0020_G0000_001_n02=In the end, I just feel like swords are a tough choice for Small Bipeds...
M6110_S0020_G0010_001_n02=We're giving up swords! Master, please take us as your disciples!
M6110_S0030_G0000_001_n02=The laser on this gun is SOOOO STROOOONG!!\nI'm so glad I got it modified!
M6110_S0030_G0010_001_n02=We're giving up guns! Master, please take us as your disciples!
M6110_S0040_G0000_001_n02=...Mutter, mutter... leap into the enemy's grasp...
M6110_S0040_G0010_001_n02=...Mutter, mutter... Congratulations...
M6110_S0050_G0000_001_n02=My dad's out there fighting!\nGo, Dad, go!
M6110_S0050_G0010_001_n02=Onii-san, congratulations!\nMy dad's a referee, but he said he's a big fan of yours!
M6110_S0060_G0000_001_n02=Fufufu... Care to buy something?
M6110_S0060_G0010_001_n02=I'm putting everyone's bodies to good use...
M6110_S0060_G0020_001_n02=Kukuku... They're cheap, you know?
M6110_S0060_G0030_001_n02=Where did these parts come from...? That's a secret.
M6110_S0060_G0040_001_n02=Hehehe... I've got all sorts of things, you know.
M6110_S0060_G0050_001_n02=All machines break eventually...
M6110_S0065_G0000_001_n02=You mean the item shop guy who was here? Hrmm... I wonder where he went.
M6110_S0065_G0010_001_n02=His friend should be in the colosseum's spectator seats, so you should try asking them.
M6110_S0065_G0020_001_n02=It's a large Machine Lifeform, so you should spot it right away.
M6110_S0070_G0000_001_n02=KILL 'EM ALL! HEY! KILL 'EM ALL!
M6110_S0070_G0010_001_n02=KILL 'EM ALL! HEY! KILL— Ah! 9S-san! Hey there!
M6110_S0080_G0000_001_n02=HEYYY! If you lose, I won't forgive you!
M6110_S0080_G0010_001_n02=HEYYY! If you lose, I won't forgive you! ...Right, 9S-san?
M6110_S0090_G0000_001_n02=ARGH! Pathetic! Have you even studied the theory!?
M6110_S0090_G0010_001_n02=ARGH! Pathetic! Have you even studied 9S-san's combat analysis data properly!?
M6110_S0100_G0000_001_n02=You suck! Are you an android or something, you slowpoke!
M6110_S0100_G0010_001_n02=You suck! I told you to learn from 9S-san!
M6110_S0110_G0000_001_n02=You gotta dig in and hit 'em from the inside angle!
M6110_S0110_G0010_001_n02=You gotta hit 'em like 9S-san would!
M6110_S0120_G0000_001_n02=That one's strong!
M6110_S0120_G0010_001_n02=That one's strong! ...I can tell. It's 9S-san in there...
M6110_S0130_G0000_001_n02=Fight! Everyone's cheering for you!
M6110_S0130_G0010_001_n02=Ah! 9S-san! I'm cheering only for you!
M6110_S0140_G0000_001_n02=Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!
M6110_S0140_G0010_001_n02=Float like 9S, sting like 9S! Become 9S!

M6110_S0150_G0010_001_n02=Kyaa! 9S-san, you're so cool! I'm so excited to be this close to you!
M6110_S0160_G0000_001_n02=This is the good part, don't talk to me!
M6110_S0160_G0010_001_n02=9S-san! This is the good part, would you mind giving some commentary?
M6110_S0170_G0000_001_n02=Go, go, go! Knock 'em down!
M6110_S0170_G0010_001_n02=Ah! 9S-san! Did you defeat that guy in the Extra Rank!?

M6110_S0220_G0010_001_n02=...Same here.
M6110_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Hey, you. You didn't buy anything in the lobby, did you?
M6110_S0230_G0010_001_n02=There was a guy selling materials in the lobby, right?\nThat guy was incredibly skilled.
M6110_S0230_G0020_001_n02=To make himself stronger, he would steal parts from the enemies he defeated and sell them...
M6110_S0230_G0030_001_n02=Lately, maybe because he started pouring his profits into upgrading his own self-data backups, he started to get a little... weird.
M6110_S0230_G0040_001_n02=You might not have realized it, but he was among the ones you defeated.
M6110_S0230_G0050_001_n02=Thank you for stopping him. And congratulations.
