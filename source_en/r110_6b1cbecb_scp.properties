M5121_S0010_G0010_300_manager=I'm sorry, could you come back later?
M5121_S0010_G0020_300_manager=Everyone is fighting for their lives, so I can't just sit here complaining... I have to do my best...
M6090_S0010_G0110_300_manager=The material storage is up ahead. Sorry, but it's restricted to authorized personnel only.
M6090_S0010_G0120_300_manager=It's restricted to authorized personnel only beyond this point.
M6090_S0010_G0121_300_manager=Such a beautiful melody... I could listen to it forever...
M6090_S0010_G0122_300_manager=You're free to come and go beyond this point.
M6090_S0010_G0130_300_resiman=We don't know where the enemy will attack from. Patrols are essential.
M6090_S0010_G0140_300_resiman=Our bodies don't have very high combat capabilities. I'm envious of you folks.
M6090_S0010_G0150_300_resiman=Hey, nice weather today, too.
M6090_S0010_G0160_300_resiman=This one seems to have taken quite a liking to you. He's a good guy, but watch out for his bragging.
M6090_S0010_G0170_300_resiman=I've heard the rumors about you. They say you're doing amazing things.
M6090_S0010_G0180_300_resiman=We aren't suited for combat, but we're good at investigation.
M6090_S0010_G0190_300_resiman=You've got the map data, right? We helped with that, you know. And besides that... eh? You're leaving already?
M6090_S0010_G0200_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0010_G0210_300_resiwoman=...Excuse me, if I don't concentrate, my hands will slip...
M6090_S0010_G0220_300_resiwoman=...
M6090_S0010_G0230_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0010_G0240_300_resiwoman=.........
M6090_S0010_G0250_300_resiwoman=Hey, knock it off already.
M6090_S0010_G0260_300_resiman=All Resistance members active in this region use this as their base.
M6090_S0010_G0270_300_resiman=That's why we have to manage people and supplies carefully.
M6090_S0010_G0280_300_resiman=If you need anything, get it from the person in charge over there.
M6090_S0010_G0290_300_resiwoman=How are you? Do you like this camp? Do YoRHa members get homesick? What about the Resistance members?
M6090_S0010_G0300_300_resiwoman=After all, the leader is so kind. Don't look at me like that. I know, it's about how fast I talk, right? My fast talking is sort of a habit
M6090_S0010_G0310_300_resiwoman=and it's quite hard to cure everyone teases me about it but sometimes my thoughts just explode and when I voice them it becomes fast talking like this
M6090_S0010_G0320_300_resiwoman=and when I'm teased I properly explain the reason and justification but see it's this fast talking right? It seems they don't understand what I'm saying at all
M6090_S0010_G0330_300_resiwoman=and everyone looks dumbfounded and it's just so frustrating! If I matched everyone's pace I couldn't convey even a tenth of what I'm thinking! Compared to that the leader is...
M6090_S0010_G0340_300_a2b=... (A person who talks a lot.)
M6090_S0010_G0360_300_a9s=... (She really talks a lot, huh.)
M6090_S0010_G0370_300_resiwoman=What is the matter? Did you have some trouble? If you have trouble please say anything without hesitation. I will support you in anything as much as possible!
M6090_S0010_G0380_300_resiwoman=Although there isn't much I can do. Because with this fast talking I don't get along well with the others and maybe because of that my memory is bad too,
M6090_S0010_G0390_300_resiwoman=so I'm mostly in the camp organizing supplies like this but recently I've become able to participate in investigations around here too and just the other day...
M6090_S0010_G0400_300_a2b=...
M6090_S0010_G0410_300_a9s=...
M6090_S0010_G0420_300_resiwoman=Before the moon broke, it seems there was something called "Night" around here too.
M6090_S0010_G0430_300_resiwoman=This guy, he's a weird one, right?
M6090_S0010_G0440_300_resiwoman=Umm, is this the first time I've met you? \nI'm sorry, my memory circuits are broken, and I forget things immediately.
M6090_S0010_G0450_300_resiwoman=YoRHa squadron's 2B and 9S... I just can't remember it...
M6090_S0010_G0490_300_resiman=Good work out there!
M6090_S0010_G0500_300_resiman=Um, I've only recently been assigned here... so, even if you ask me about the area, I don't know much...
M6090_S0010_G0510_300_resiman=West of the camp is the Factory Ruins, northwest is the Desert... I have to remember this properly before the investigation mission...
M6090_S0010_G0520_300_resiman=Are you performing maintenance on your body regularly? \nIf you want to upgrade, you should tell the woman out front.
M6090_S0010_G0530_300_resiman=YoRHa prosthetic bodies are expensive, so take care of them.
M6090_S0010_G0540_300_resiman=I serviced the camp's transporter so you can return to the Bunker. \nUse it as you like.
M6090_S0010_G0550_300_resiman=I want to service other transporters too, but the Machine Lifeforms are in the way and the work isn't progressing.
M6090_S0010_G0560_300_resiwoman=Recently my chest area feels restless... I wonder what's wrong?
M6090_S0010_G0570_300_resiwoman=I was told there's no abnormality in my prosthetic body... \nEven though I'm an android, it's strange.
M6090_S0010_G0580_300_resiman=My job is looking over the camp's luggage and checking the stock of supplies.
M6090_S0010_G0590_300_resiman=The system is that procurement officers from various places gather missing supplies, and we manage them all here.
M6090_S0010_G0600_300_resiman=Recently, investigation around here is active, so I'm so busy I'm overwhelmed.
M6090_S0010_G0610_300_resiwoman=Whisper whisper... Yeah yeah...
M6090_S0010_G0620_300_resiwoman=Hm? You're curious what we're talking about? \nIt's a secret.
M6090_S0010_G0630_300_resiwoman=Whisper whisper... That's right...
M6090_S0010_G0640_300_resiwoman=Eavesdropping is in bad taste!
M6090_S0010_G0650_300_resiman=Good grief... who put this in so haphazardly...
M6090_S0010_G0660_300_resiman=With this much luggage, just managing it is a struggle.
M6090_S0010_G0670_300_resiman=Ahh, I'd like to have a drink after work.
M6090_S0010_G0680_300_resiman=Apparently humans used to gather with comrades and drink alcohol like this at the end of work. \nIt's a culture we should adopt too. Don't you think?
M6090_S0010_G0690_300_resiman=To have been at war ever since we were born... it's tough, isn't it.
M6090_S0010_G0700_300_resiman=Even if you strain yourself, the world will only be what it will be. \nLet's take it easy.
M6090_S0010_G0710_300_resiwoman=Hello. \nDid you come to take a break too?
M6090_S0010_G0720_300_resiwoman=He should rest a little too, but it's always just work work work.
M6090_S0010_G0730_300_resiwoman=Just when I think he's returned from investigation, he's helping the tool shop... \nIt's not like he's good at it, but he seems to accept anything.
M6090_S0010_G0740_300_resiman=Do this here... Uuun...
M6090_S0010_G0750_300_resiman=Strange... why won't it move?
M6090_S0010_G0760_300_resiman=Day after day, carry and carry and there's no end... \nA little break! A break!
M6090_S0010_G0770_300_resiman=There's lots of work, my colleagues are useless, my boss is tyrannical... \nOn top of that, the war continues as usual.
M6090_S0010_G0780_300_resiman=Isn't there at least one good thing...
M6090_S0010_G0790_300_resiman=Right clear! Left clear! \nUmu, no abnormalities today either!
M6090_S0010_G0800_300_resiman=Leave the security to me. \nI won't let a single mouse into the warehouse.
M6090_S0020_G0110_300_resiman=Doesn't it feel like the enemy has been more active lately? I hope it's just my imagination...
M6090_S0020_G0120_300_resiman=I'm secretly training so I can protect everyone when the time comes. I'm still inexperienced, though.
M6090_S0020_G0130_300_resiman=The YoRHa squadron is amazing. To think you can destroy so many Machine Lifeforms.
M6090_S0020_G0140_300_resiman=Be careful on the road. Well, you'll probably be fine even if I don't say it.
M6090_S0020_G0150_300_resiman=Between the incident with the large-scale weapon the other day and everything else, you're really something. Let's end this war at this rate.
M6090_S0020_G0160_300_resiman=You all put the information we gather to good use...
M6090_S0020_G0170_300_resiman=Some prefer procuring supplies since intel gathering is dangerous, but it's a rewarding job.
M6090_S0020_G0180_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0020_G0190_300_resiwoman=I'm busy with the records of the caved-in area. I'm sorry, but please leave me alone.
M6090_S0020_G0200_300_resiwoman=...
M6090_S0020_G0210_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0020_G0220_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0020_G0230_300_resiwoman=You're being persistent.
M6090_S0020_G0240_300_resiman=Do you need something with the leader? She may not look it, but she's a worrier, so don't be too reckless.
M6090_S0020_G0250_300_resiman=Make sure you're properly supplied. Self-management is an important part of the job, too.
M6090_S0020_G0260_300_resiwoman=Hello! Are you well? Lately there have been a lot of strange incidents one after another, right, and only in this area. I'm really worried and worried and worried,
M6090_S0020_G0270_300_resiwoman=I was attacked by Machine Lifeforms when I went out the other day too, well, compared to a large-scale weapon they probably aren't much of an opponent, but I was really surprised,
M6090_S0020_G0280_300_resiwoman=My colleague who was investigating with me saved me instantly so I wasn't injured but at that time I really thought I would die. Friends are the ones you should rely on.
M6090_S0020_G0290_300_resiwoman=I really can't thank them enough, ah I understand, those are eyes saying don't talk too much I know. But since you came let's talk a little more
M6090_S0020_G0300_300_a2b=...
M6090_S0020_G0310_300_a9s=...
M6090_S0020_G0320_300_resiwoman=Ah, you came again! To come all this way when you are busy, everyone ignores me because my stories are long but you always talk to me,
M6090_S0020_G0330_300_resiwoman=you are truly kind aren't you. Speaking of kind the leader treated my injury the other day, no I just got cut while carrying luggage,
M6090_S0020_G0340_300_resiwoman=but the leader was incredibly worried, certainly a lot of blood came out but it was totally not a big deal compared to how it looked so I felt kind of sorry,
M6090_S0020_G0350_300_resiwoman=I always think to be careful but I often get careless unintentionally. I'm an android so if I repair I get fixed immediately,
M6090_S0020_G0360_300_resiwoman=but the leader always says if you get used to this it will become something irreversible. The leader is truly a worrier, besides that the leader is
M6090_S0020_G0370_300_a2b=...
M6090_S0020_G0380_300_a9s=...
M6090_S0020_G0390_300_resiwoman=If it isn't the rumored YoRHa member. \nI'm hearing about your exploits.
M6090_S0020_G0400_300_resiwoman=When you don't have energy, you should get some shared from this guy. \nHe's so energetic it makes me tired though.
M6090_S0020_G0410_300_resiwoman=Recently I'm making sure to take memos. \nIf I write it on paper, even if I forget I can remember it again, right?
M6090_S0020_G0420_300_resiwoman=But it's scary isn't it... because losing your memory means you stop being yourself...
M6090_S0020_G0480_300_resiman=Good work on the mission! \nI feel like I'm getting used to the environment here little by little myself.
M6090_S0020_G0490_300_resiman=Umm, north of the camp is the forest, northeast is the Machine Lifeform village... right?
M6090_S0020_G0500_300_resiman=Lately, everyone is busy. \nI'm helping with maintenance, but it's quite difficult.
M6090_S0020_G0510_300_resiman=Are you tired? \nWorking hard is good, but keep it in moderation.
M6090_S0020_G0520_300_resiman=I'm going around repairing other transporters now, but the enemy breaks them as soon as I fix them.
M6090_S0020_G0530_300_resiman=Jeez, the vending machine camouflage has no meaning anymore.
M6090_S0020_G0540_300_resiman=If there are Machine Lifeforms around a transporter, punish them for me.
M6090_S0020_G0550_300_resiwoman=You two are always getting along well. \nI'm envious.
M6090_S0020_G0560_300_resiwoman=Keep it a secret from everyone, but I think there are good guys even among Machine Lifeforms...
M6090_S0020_G0570_300_resiwoman=If only Machine Lifeforms would all just perish.
M6090_S0020_G0580_300_resiman=Yo, YoRHa squadron Ace-dono. \nThe support system is perfect so you guys can fight in the best condition.
M6090_S0020_G0590_300_resiman=I'm working. \nGo on, shoo shoo!
M6090_S0020_G0600_300_resiwoman=Whisper whisper... I see...
M6090_S0020_G0610_300_resiwoman=You want to be included? It's still too early for you.
M6090_S0020_G0620_300_resiwoman=Whisper whisper... And then...
M6090_S0020_G0630_300_resiwoman=Even if you strain your ears to listen, it's not a big story.
M6090_S0020_G0640_300_resiman=Umm, transfer this to the box over there...
M6090_S0020_G0650_300_resiman=It's good that we started trading with Pascal's place, but those guys are rough/imprecise despite being machines.
M6090_S0020_G0660_300_resiman=When the center was blown away I found some old alcohol, I tried drinking a little and that stuff is good.
M6090_S0020_G0670_300_resiman=...Keep this secret from the leader.
M6090_S0020_G0680_300_resiman=I don't know if drinking alcohol lowers information processing functions, but my head gets fuzzy, and everything feels like it doesn't matter.
M6090_S0020_G0690_300_resiman=Maybe that's what they call a dream-like state.
M6090_S0020_G0700_300_resiman=It's been hectic lately, and I haven't been able to rest properly. \nHave to take a break once in a while.
M6090_S0020_G0710_300_resiman=You say I'm always resting? \nDon't worry about the details.
M6090_S0020_G0720_300_resiwoman=Hello. \nPlease relax.
M6090_S0020_G0730_300_resiwoman=You always look busy, but you have to make time for your precious person once in a while.
M6090_S0020_G0740_300_resiwoman=Because you can't be together forever. \n...Though this person won't listen even if I say it.
M6090_S0020_G0750_300_resiman=This fits here... connect this...
M6090_S0020_G0760_300_resiman=Uuun... why are there parts left over?
M6090_S0030_G0110_300_resiman=Looks like you're still alive, too.
M6090_S0030_G0120_300_resiman=We have to survive, no matter what. This is no time to lose heart.
M6090_S0030_G0160_300_resiman=Hey, are you okay? A lot has happened recently, you must be exhausted.
M6090_S0030_G0170_300_resiman=I'm going to see my job through to the end. That's all that matters.
M6090_S0030_G0180_300_resiwoman=*whisper whisper*... yeah, yeah...
M6090_S0030_G0190_300_a2b=......
M6090_S0030_G0200_300_a9s=......
M6090_S0030_G0210_300_a2=Hey, who are you talking to?
M6090_S0030_G0220_300_resiwoman=Eavesdropping is in poor taste.
M6090_S0030_G0230_300_resiman=*hic*... Booze is the best~ Hey, is there any more booze~?
M6090_S0030_G0240_300_resiman=...Whaddaya want...? You got a problem...?
M6090_S0030_G0250_300_resiman=...Why did I have to be the one to survive?
M6090_S0030_G0260_300_resiman=Not someone like me... a better person, or a more serious person should have survived.
M6090_S0030_G0270_300_resiman=You think so too, right?
M6090_S0030_G0280_300_resiman=Even in a situation like this, I'm a scum who's too scared of fighting to move from here.
M6090_S0030_G0290_300_resiman=How nice would it be if I could throw everything away and say it doesn't matter...
M6090_S0080_G0000_300_resiwoman=Bunker, this is the Resistance Camp. Transmitting surface data.
M6090_S0080_G0010_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0080_G0020_300_resiman=It's you. How's it going? Don't be too reckless.
M6090_S0080_G0030_300_resiman=Make sure you're properly supplied. Self-management is an important part of the job, too.
M6090_S0080_G0040_300_resiman=Another injury?
M6090_S0080_G0050_300_resiman=If not, that's good. We can only do simple repairs here...
M6090_S0080_G0060_300_resiman=Don't push yourself too hard... though I know that's impossible to ask. But take care of yourself.
M6090_S0080_G0070_300_resiman=Are you saving your data properly? Even if you have a spare body, if your data gets corrupted, it's the same as being dead.
M6090_S0080_G0080_300_resiman=Save your data frequently. It'll be too late once it's too late.
M6090_S0080_G0090_300_resiwoman=I know the body is just a vessel, but it pains my heart to see the injured...
M6090_S0080_G0100_300_resiwoman=Are you hurt? Don't be reckless, and make sure you rest properly.
M6090_S0080_G0110_300_resiman=Hey, are you sure you should be slacking off here? Your comrades need you, right? Get going.
M6090_S0080_G0120_300_resiman=There's not much we can do, but... we're counting on you, ace of the YoRHa squadron!
M6090_S0080_G0160_300_resiman=What's wrong? Don't worry, I'll protect this place.
M6090_S0080_G0170_300_resiman=This is all we can do. So we have to at least see it through to the end.
M6090_S0080_G0180_300_resiman=For you guys to be in a place like this... don't tell me, enemy attack!? \nThis is bad! We have to move the materials out immediately!!!
M6090_S0080_G0190_300_resiman=...Eh, no? \nGood grief, don't scare me.
M6090_S0080_G0200_300_resiman=The materials here are our lifeline. \nI'll protect them even if I have to trade my life.
