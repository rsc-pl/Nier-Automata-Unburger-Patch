M1010_S0010_G0000_300_a9s=2B-san, can you hear me?\nI'll begin the boot setup now.
M1010_S0010_G0010_300_a9s=First, please check the system brightness settings.
M1010_S0010_G0020_300_a9s=Huh? You don't know how to adjust the brightness?\nI think it corresponds to one of the inputs...
M1010_S0010_G0030_300_a9s=...Er, understood. Just a moment, please.
M1010_S0010_G0040_300_a9s=Found a guide! Please follow its instructions.
M1010_S0010_G0050_300_a9s=Okay then, let's get started.
M1010_S0010_G0060_300_a9s=Let's adjust these one by one.
M1010_S0010_G0070_300_a9s=First, please go ahead and adjust the brightness.
M1010_S0010_G0080_300_a9s=2B-san, is this setting okay?
M1010_S0010_G0090_300_a2b=Yes
M1010_S0010_G0100_300_a9s=Roger that.
M1010_S0010_G0110_300_a2b=No
M1010_S0010_G0120_300_a9s=Oh, right. Just so you know, the setup process is being recorded.
M1010_S0010_G0130_300_a9s=Alright, next up are the Voice Recognition settings.
M1010_S0010_G0140_300_a9s=Voice Recognition is currently muted, so please adjust it.\nI'm going to call out to you now, so please set it where you can hear my voice.
M1010_S0010_G0150_300_a9s=2B-saaan, can you hear meee?
M1010_S0010_G0160_300_a9s=Ummm, hellooo? Please adjust it so you can hear meee.
M1010_S0010_G0170_300_a9s=Please adjust the setting so you can hear my voice.
M1010_S0010_G0180_300_a9s=U-um... this is embarrassing, so could you hurry it up...?
M1010_S0010_G0190_300_a9s=Huh? You can't hear my voice, can you?
M1010_S0010_G0200_300_a9s=Is this okay? No problems?
M1010_S0010_G0220_300_a9s=Alright, that completes the setup.
M1010_S0010_G0240_300_a2b=I'm fine... Your voice... it's somehow reassuring.
M1010_S0010_G0250_300_a9s=!! ...Th-thank you very much.\nThis completes the options setup.
M1010_S0010_G0260_300_a9s=Urgh! ...W-what?! My heart rate's rising on its own!?
M1010_S0010_G0270_300_a9s=What is this... Huh? It's back to normal...
M1010_S0010_G0280_300_a9s=Huh? The Self-Destruct Permission setting is missing.\nHold on! I can restore it in a second!
M1010_S0010_G0290_300_a9s=I could set it myself, but...\nit's regulation, so please set it yourself, 2B-san.
M1010_S0010_G0300_300_a9s=...??? No, that won't do. Please turn it ON properly.
M1010_S0010_G0310_300_a9s=Ummm, you can't do that. Barring special cases, this setting is mandatory.
M1010_S0010_G0320_300_a9s=I can't overlook this. Please authorize it.
M1010_S0010_G0330_300_a9s=Geez! Don't make this so hard for me. It's regulations.
M1010_S0010_G0340_300_a9s=OK.\nWhen the time comes, we have to be prepared to complete the mission even if it means sacrificing our bodies.
M1010_S0010_G0360_300_a9s=Once you're done setting it, please close this screen.
M1010_S0010_G0370_300_a9s=Ah, you enabled the Vibration Detection function.\nIn that case, let's do a simple test.
M1010_S0010_G0380_300_a9s=I'm going to give your shoulder a light tap now.
M1010_S0010_G0390_300_a9s=How was that? Could you feel it?
M1010_S0010_G0410_300_a9s=OK, test complete.
M1010_S0010_G0420_300_a9s=Huh? That's odd. The settings should be correct.
M1010_S0010_G0430_300_a9s=Let's try changing the spot I tap. Next, I'll lightly tap your arm.
M1010_S0010_G0440_300_a9s=You felt it that time, right?
M1010_S0010_G0460_300_a9s=OK, test complete.
M1010_S0010_G0480_300_a9s=Huh!? Really??
M1010_S0010_G0490_300_a9s=2B, I'm sure you felt that...\nAre you teasing me...?
M1010_S0010_G0500_300_a9s=Hmm, can't be helped then. How about here?
M1010_S0010_G0510_300_a9s=Let's try here next... though I feel like I'm gonna get yelled at for this.
M1010_S0010_G0520_300_a9s=...How about that?
M1010_S0010_G0540_300_a9s=OK, test complete.
M1010_S0010_G0560_300_a9s=Really!?
M1010_S0010_G0570_300_a9s=You really didn't feel a thing?
M1010_S0010_G0580_300_a9s=Th-then how about this?
M1010_S0010_G0590_300_a9s=I-I'm not taking responsibility for this anymore...
M1010_S0010_G0600_300_a9s=How about that?
M1010_S0010_G0620_300_a9s=Yes... thank you very much.
M1010_S0010_G0640_300_a9s=Hmm. I can't figure out the cause right now,\nso you'll just have to get a full diagnostic later.
M1010_S0010_G0650_300_a9s=For now, the test is over.
M1010_S0010_G0660_300_a9s=True, self-destructing is unpleasant...
M1010_S0010_G0670_300_a9s=Regulations say the Self-Destruct function is mandatory, but... I won't tell the Commander.
M1010_S0010_G0680_300_a9s=You... don't want to hear my voice?? I mean, that's fine, but... why...
M1010_S0010_G0690_300_a9s=Every single setting I helped with has been overturned.
M1010_S0010_G0700_300_a9s=I wonder if she hates me... Can I really get along with 2B-san from here on out...?
M4100_S0000_G0000_300_sele=Yes
M4100_S0000_G0010_300_sele=No
