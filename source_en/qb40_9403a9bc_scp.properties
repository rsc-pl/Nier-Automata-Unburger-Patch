M6010_S0010_G0640_300_ys=...This side is smooth.\nAh, no signs of being particularly noticed...
M6010_S0010_G0650_300_ys=What are you, go over there.
M6010_S0010_G0660_300_ys=Hey, you're persistent.\nWhat communication? That has nothing to do with you.
M6010_S0010_G0670_300_ys=...Ah, it's a problem on this end.\nDon't worry about it.
M6010_S0010_G0680_300_ys=Go on, hurry up and go.
M6010_S0010_G0690_300_ys=...Operator explanations are too detailed.\nAs long as I have the necessary data on site, I can handle the rest appropriately myself.
M6010_S0010_G0700_300_ys=My partner seems quite nervous...\nDo I look that unreliable?
M6010_S0010_G0710_300_ys=The Operator-san explains politely, but I can't understand at all...\nI'm worried I'll drag my senior down...
M6010_S0010_G0720_300_ys=...Um, excuse me... I don't quite understand the explanation...\nCould you ask one more time...?
M6010_S0010_G0730_300_op=...That is the outline of the mission.\nNext are the details...
M6010_S0010_G0740_300_op=...Do you need something?\nI am currently transmitting a mission, so please do not interrupt.
M6010_S0010_G0750_300_op=Maybe because it hasn't been long since this child was manufactured, she seems really nervous.
M6010_S0010_G0760_300_op=Information should be short and concise; if you don't summarize just the main points, you can't be called a full-fledged Operator.
M6010_S0010_G0770_300_op=Even if she messes up a little, I'd follow up.\nWe're partners... You guys are the same, right?
M6010_S0010_G0780_300_ys=You don't have to worry that much.\nI have enough Recovery Medicine, and I can manage my own physical condition.
M6010_S0010_G0790_300_ys=...Sigh...
M6010_S0010_G0800_300_ys=I'm grateful she worries, but...\nI feel like I won't be able to sortie forever at this rate...
M6010_S0010_G0810_300_op=Are you really okay?
M6010_S0010_G0820_300_op=Did you bring Recovery Medicine? Do you have enough numbers?\nIf your vital reaction drops, you'll treat it immediately, right?
M6010_S0010_G0830_300_op=Sigh... I'm worried...\nMaybe I should put in a request to convert to an Operator model now...
M6010_S0010_G0940_300_ys=Listen up you guys! The survival of humanity rests in our hands!\nBrace yourselves and handle the mission!
M6010_S0010_G0950_300_ys=If you find Machine Lifeforms, show no mercy!\nDo not forgive evil!
M6010_S0010_G0960_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0010_G0970_300_ys=My dream is to defeat many Machine Lifeforms and contribute to humanity's victory,\nlike the Captain.
M6010_S0010_G0980_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0010_G0990_300_ys=I'm not suited for fighting enemies, but I was assigned to the combat squadron...\nI wonder if I can change to an Operator even now...
M6010_S0010_G1000_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0010_G1010_300_ys=The Captain is the type to obsess over form.\nInstead of shouting orders in a place like this, I'd like to quickly go on the mission but...
M6010_S0010_G1020_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0010_G1030_300_op=She's getting too heated up in the orders and hasn't conveyed the mission content, will it be okay?
M6010_S0010_G1040_300_op=Well, I'll contact them once they reach the surface, so it's fine.
M6010_S0010_G1050_300_op=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G0640_300_ys=...Do you guys believe? Who is this war for?
M6010_S0020_G0650_300_ys=...It's nothing, that was a slip of the tongue.\nDon't worry about it.
M6010_S0020_G0660_300_ys=It's useless to watch me.
M6010_S0020_G0670_300_ys=It's not like I'm plotting a rebellion.\nIf you want, will you report me to Command?
M6010_S0020_G0680_300_ys=...Though they won't listen anyway.
M6010_S0020_G0690_300_ys=How is your condition?\nWe are well...so-so.
M6010_S0020_G0700_300_ys=Compared to the beginning, it's become much better, but still not enough.\nWe have to devote ourselves more.
M6010_S0020_G0710_300_ys=Recently, I've gotten a little used to missions.\nI'm still dragging everyone down, but someday I too...
M6010_S0020_G0720_300_ys=...Mission understood!\nI will do my very best!
M6010_S0020_G0730_300_op=...That is the outline of the mission.\nI will contact you with details later.
M6010_S0020_G0740_300_op=...What is it? Those eyes.
M6010_S0020_G0750_300_op=Lately she's gotten completely used to the job, so I'm a little lonely.
M6010_S0020_G0760_300_op=You guys are perfectly in sync too.\nWe can't lose either.
M6010_S0020_G0770_300_ys=When comrades are fighting, I can't be the only one to pull back because it's dangerous.
M6010_S0020_G0780_300_ys=The data is properly backed up, and injuries heal quickly if repaired.\n...Operators are worrywarts.
M6010_S0020_G0790_300_ys=Combat squadrons exist to fight.
M6010_S0020_G0800_300_ys=I too want to contribute to humanity's victory together with my comrades.\nYou guys are the same, right?
M6010_S0020_G0810_300_op=Listen okay? Absolutely do not let your guard down, okay?
M6010_S0020_G0820_300_op=If you think it's dangerous, pull back immediately and leave it to other members... Are you listening properly?
M6010_S0020_G0830_300_op=...The other day, by chance, you came back unharmed with good luck but...\nWhen I think you might get seriously injured next time, my heart is heavy...
M6010_S0020_G0840_300_op=Should I model change to a combat specialization...?
M6010_S0020_G0950_300_ys=You guys! You did well in the previous operation!\nAt this rate, we will play an active role and regain glory for humanity!
M6010_S0020_G0960_300_ys=Justice losing is something that must not happen.\nFor the sake of the comrades who scattered before us, we will definitely win.
M6010_S0020_G0970_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0020_G0980_300_ys=I want to contribute to humanity's victory too, but I'm always dragging everyone down...\nNext time for sure...definitely...
M6010_S0020_G0990_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0020_G1000_300_ys=...For me, I hate that someone dies for humanity, people I've never even seen.
M6010_S0020_G1010_300_ys=I wish we could all just stay living here like this...\nI wonder why that isn't allowed.
M6010_S0020_G1020_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G1030_300_ys=The Captain, whenever someone is about to get hit, she always covers them.
M6010_S0020_G1040_300_ys=Every time that happens, her data gets rewound, so she doesn't even have many memories spent with us, she's an idiot.
M6010_S0020_G1050_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G1060_300_op=If peace with Machine Lifeforms is established, there probably won't be any more sacrifices,\nbut there are people who can't accept that so simply.
M6010_S0020_G1070_300_op=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0080_G0340_300_op=<<Surface squadron, this is Bunker. Transferring data necessary for the next mission>>
M6010_S0080_G0350_300_op=What are you doing in a place like this?
M6010_S0080_G0360_300_op=The combat squadron is fighting on the surface even now.\nPlease head out quickly.
M6010_S0080_G0370_300_op=<<Surface squadron, this is Bunker>>
M6010_S0080_G0380_300_op=<<Your vital reaction seems to be dropping a little, so\ndon't push yourself and get treatment>>
M6010_S0080_G0390_300_op=...Oh my, what's wrong in a place like this?\nWhile you guys are resting, maybe I'll take the credit.
M6010_S0080_G0400_300_op=<<Surface squadron, this is Bunker>>
M6010_S0080_G0410_300_op=<<Are there any abnormalities?>>
M6010_S0080_G0415_300_op=<<Vital reaction seems normal, but undetectable errors might be lurking\nso return soon for maintenance...>>
M6010_S0080_G0420_300_op=<<Ah wait, don't cut it off!!!>>
M6010_S0080_G0430_300_op=Communication won't connect... Did something happen...
M6010_S0080_G0440_300_op=<<Hello, can you hear me? Hellooooo!>>
M6010_S0080_G0510_300_op=<<From Bunker to Surface squadron.\nMission info has been updated, so I'm transferring the data>>
M6010_S0080_G0520_300_op=<<Listen properly to the Captain's orders, and absolutely don't overdo it!>>
M6010_S0080_G0530_300_op=Oh my, you, is the mission over already?
