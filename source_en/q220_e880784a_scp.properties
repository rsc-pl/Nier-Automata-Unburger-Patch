M5220_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2-san. Did you need something?
M5220_S0010_G0010_001_a2=...Because I got the filter for free.
M5220_S0010_G0020_001_a2=I won't feel settled until I return the favor.
M5220_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=Goodness, that is conscientious...
M5220_S0010_G0040_001_a2=If there is anything I can help with, I will help.
M5220_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=...Actually, there is something I am troubled by.
M5220_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=A ferocious robot has started appearing at the playground and attacking the children.
M5220_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=It is presumptuous of me, but could you exterminate that robot?
M5220_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=I cannot ask other people for something like this. Please.
M5220_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Accept.
M5220_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Refuse.
M5220_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=...That is true. You must have your own circumstances.
M5220_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Pardon me.
M5220_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=Could you please exterminate the ferocious robot appearing at the children's playground?
M5220_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=Thank you very much!
M5220_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=I will give you proper thanks, so please, I am counting on you.
M5220_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=Please exterminate the robot rampaging at the children's playground.
M5220_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=Please, I am counting on you.
M5220_S0020_G0005_001_pod042=Detected hostile Machine Lifeform.
M5220_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, thank you very much!
M5220_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=You exterminated that robot for us.
M5220_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=Please accept this reward. Here, don't hold back.
M5220_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=...We are pacifists. We created this village because we hate fighting.
M5220_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=But, as a result of throwing away weapons, we lost the means to resist those with power.
M5220_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=Within the village, there are those who claim we should destroy surrounding enemies to protect our peace.
M5220_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=A2-san... what should we do?
M5220_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Who knows.
M5220_S0030_G0080_001_a2=Deciding that is you, Pascal. Isn't it?
M5220_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=That... is true...
M5220_S0030_G0100_001_a2=Also, if anything attacks me, I will destroy this village without hesitation.
M5220_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=...Haha. Understood.
M5220_S0030_G0120_001_pascal=A2-san.
M5220_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=If you like, please take a look at this village.
M5220_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=I want you to know more about us.
M5220_S0030_G0150_001_a2=...If I feel like it.
