M5020_S0010_G0000_001_sarutoru=Existence precedes essence...
M5020_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Um, excuse me.
M5020_S0010_G0020_001_sarutoru=Man cannot be anything other than what he purposes to be, and also...
M5020_S0010_G0020_300_n02=The Machine Lifeform with heavy face paint is on the first floor of the village.
M5020_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=Hel-looo!
M5020_S0010_G0030_300_n02=Did you learn a little about Sartre?
M5020_S0010_G0040_001_sarutoru=...What is it? Who are you?
M5020_S0010_G0050_001_sarutoru=Ah, I see. You also wish to receive a lecture from me, do you not?
M5020_S0010_G0060_001_sarutoru=Then, let us first speak of Existentialism.
M5020_S0010_G0070_001_sarutoru=Are you listening? Essential existence is that which opposes actual existence...
M5020_S0010_G0080_001_sarutoru=To begin with, actual existence is...
M5020_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=He's hopeless... this guy.
M5020_S0010_G0100_001_n02=Ah... It's useless to talk to Sartre.
M5020_S0010_G0110_001_n02=He only talks about difficult things like "Philosophy."
M5020_S0010_G0120_001_n02=If you want to know about him, you should try asking his fans.
M5020_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=...Fans?
M5020_S0010_G0140_001_n02=Strangely enough, there are fans of Sartre in various places.
M5020_S0010_G0150_001_n02=I don't understand why he's popular, though.
M5020_S0010_G0160_001_n02=There was one in this village too...
M5020_S0010_G0170_001_n02=The Machine Lifeform with heavy paint on her face is the one.
M5020_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Hello... There's something I want to ask.
M5020_S0020_G0000_300_sarutoru=Oh my, have you also come to take my lecture?
M5020_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Do you know a robot named Sartre?
M5020_S0020_G0010_300_a9s=No, I'm good.
M5020_S0020_G0020_001_robogirl=Of course! Sartre-san is someone who knows everything and is so reliable.
M5020_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Reliable...? That guy?
M5020_S0020_G0040_001_robogirl=There are many things I don't know, so I wrote a letter. Please deliver it for me!
M5020_S0020_G0040_300_robogirl=Did you deliver the letter?
M5020_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=H-huh?
M5020_S0020_G0050_300_robogirl=Were you able to deliver the present?
M5020_S0020_G0060_001_robogirl=I don't want to lose to the women in the Desert and Amusement Park...!
M5020_S0020_G0060_300_robogirl=Did you pass on the gift?
M5020_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=There are others...?
M5020_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Or rather, do they have genders...? These guys.
M5020_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Um...
M5020_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Do you know a robot named Sartre who is in Pascal's village...?
M5020_S0020_G0110_001_robogirl=Sartre-sama is a very mysterious and strange person.\nAnd he is so cool.
M5020_S0020_G0120_001_a2b=Mysterious...? Cool...?
M5020_S0020_G0130_001_robogirl=I have prepared a present perfect for him.
M5020_S0020_G0140_001_robogirl=Please, deliver it to him.
M5020_S0020_G0150_001_robogirl=I won't let that woman in the Desert... interfere with my romance!
M5020_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Excuse me~!
M5020_S0020_G0170_001_robogirl=Ah!
M5020_S0020_G0180_001_a9s=Eh?
M5020_S0020_G0190_001_robogirl=You guys came from Sartre-sama's village, didn't you...
M5020_S0020_G0200_001_robogirl=I can tell... I can tell by the smell...
M5020_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=That's kinda scary...
M5020_S0020_G0220_001_robogirl=That person is full of inquiring mind, passionate, and wonderful. He is my idol.
M5020_S0020_G0230_001_a2b=...That guy is?
M5020_S0020_G0240_001_robogirl=You have no eye for men, do you~. The type who looks like she'd be deceived by a man.
M5020_S0020_G0250_001_a2b=...
M5020_S0020_G0260_001_robogirl=Ah, that's right.
M5020_S0020_G0270_001_robogirl=I found something Sartre-sama seems likely to be interested in. Take it to him!
M5020_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=...2B, there's something I've been thinking.
M5020_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=What?
M5020_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=He's being... gloried, isn't he? Sartre-san.
M5020_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=Certainly... quite a bit...
M5020_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Um, excuse me~
M5020_S0040_G0010_001_sarutoru=I see, is that so.
M5020_S0040_G0020_001_sarutoru=A dream is a perfect realization within a closed imaginary world, and...
M5020_S0040_G0030_001_a9s=Sartre. We're holding a present addressed to you...
M5020_S0040_G0040_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0050_001_sarutoru=Interesting. A letter, is it?
M5020_S0040_G0060_001_a2b=The female robot who gave us that...
M5020_S0040_G0070_001_a2b=Said you knew everything and were reliable.
M5020_S0040_G0080_001_sarutoru=Hmph, by the way, do you not think that existence precedes essence?
M5020_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Um, what about the reply to the letter?
M5020_S0040_G0100_001_sarutoru=I will not write one. Why?
M5020_S0040_G0110_001_a9s=Wasn't there a question written in the letter...?
M5020_S0040_G0120_001_sarutoru=Is there an obligation that one must absolutely answer questions?
M5020_S0040_G0130_001_sarutoru=Who decided that obligation?
M5020_S0040_G0140_001_a2b=...It is useless to talk any further.
M5020_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=...Agreed.
M5020_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=Sartre, got a moment?
M5020_S0040_G0170_001_sarutoru=Time that passes by is, in short, lost time.
M5020_S0040_G0180_001_sarutoru=That is an indolent and utterly lethargic—
M5020_S0040_G0185_001_a9s=Also, there's another present...
M5020_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=We're holding a present addressed to Sartre.
M5020_S0040_G0200_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=Er... it's this.
M5020_S0040_G0220_001_sarutoru=...Hmm, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0230_001_a2b=Said you were mysterious and cool.
M5020_S0040_G0240_001_sarutoru=Hmph, it is mere glass. Nothing more than glass. In short, this is—
M5020_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Um, do you have any words for the woman who gave this to you...?
M5020_S0040_G0260_001_sarutoru=None. Nothing at all. It is just simple glass, after all.
M5020_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=Sigh...
M5020_S0040_G0280_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5020_S0040_G0290_001_sarutoru=Already, there is no need for all things. This place, this village, and even I—
M5020_S0040_G0295_001_a2b=Also, we have been entrusted with one more present.
M5020_S0040_G0300_001_a2b=We have been entrusted with a present addressed to you.
M5020_S0040_G0310_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0320_001_a9s=Er... it's this fossil.
M5020_S0040_G0330_001_sarutoru=...Hmm, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0340_001_a2b=Said you were full of inquiring mind and passionate.
M5020_S0040_G0350_001_sarutoru=A mechanical fossil? It serves no purpose whatsoever.
M5020_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Um, do you have any words for the woman who gave this to you...?
M5020_S0040_G0370_001_sarutoru=None. Nothing at all. It is useless junk, after all.
M5020_S0040_G0380_001_a9s=Junk...
M5020_S0040_G0390_001_a2b=...
M5020_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Sartre paid absolutely no attention to the presents, did he.
M5020_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=...They might be waiting for a reply,
M5020_S0050_G0020_001_a9s=So should we at least convey his words to the fan Machine Lifeforms...?
M5020_S0060_G0000_001_robogirl=Ah, finally here! What was the reply from Sartre-san?
M5020_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=About that... he just said he has no obligation to reply.
M5020_S0060_G0020_001_robogirl=AS EXPECTED!! That cool side of Sartre-san is the best!
M5020_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=It's the best, huh...
M5020_S0060_G0040_001_robogirl=You gave the present to Sartre-sama, didn't you?
M5020_S0060_G0050_001_robogirl=So, what was his reply?
M5020_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Er... He said it was just simple glass.
M5020_S0060_G0070_001_robogirl=Oh my!! Words that strike at the very truth of things!
M5020_S0060_G0080_001_robogirl=I will follow you for my whole life! Sartre-sama!
M5020_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=Whole life... huh.
M5020_S0060_G0100_001_robogirl=Hey! Did Sartre-sama say anything about my present?
M5020_S0060_G0110_001_a9s=Well... He said it was useless junk.
M5020_S0060_G0120_001_robogirl=Aaaah... What sadistic play!
M5020_S0060_G0130_001_robogirl=It gives me chills!
M5020_S0060_G0140_001_a9s=...
M5020_S0070_G0000_001_a9s=I'm kind of tired now...
M5020_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=Sartre is a man who doesn't think of others...
M5020_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=And the partners selfishly impose their fantasies and blindly believe...
M5020_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=What meaning on earth is there in this relationship?
M5020_S0070_G0040_001_a2b=...You should ask Sartre.
M5020_S0070_G0050_001_a9s=...Huh? I wonder where Sartre went.
M5020_S0070_G0060_001_n02=Ah, it's you guys.
M5020_S0070_G0070_001_n02=If it's Sartre, he's not here anymore.
M5020_S0070_G0070_300_robogirl=I have to write a new letter to Sartre-san.\nI won't lose to other women!
M5020_S0070_G0080_001_n02=He went on a journey.
M5020_S0070_G0080_300_robogirl=Haa... Sartre-sama...\nWhat should I do to make you look my way...
M5020_S0070_G0090_001_a9s=A journey?
M5020_S0070_G0090_300_robogirl=You... seem close to Sartre-sama, but I won't forgive you if you try to get a head start...
M5020_S0070_G0100_001_n02=Yeah... something about going to find himself, or whatever.
M5020_S0070_G0110_001_n02=I was entrusted with a letter for you guys, so I'll give it to you.
M5020_S0070_G0120_001_a9s=He was a person of incomprehensible meaning to the very end...
M5020_S0070_G0130_001_a9s=I wonder if men and women among humanity also had such strange relationships.
M5020_S0070_G0140_001_a2b=...Who knows.
