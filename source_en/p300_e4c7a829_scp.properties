M6010_S0090_G0320_300_ys=......Ah, wait a second, 2B is here......
M6010_S0090_G0330_300_ys=Come on, you have things to do too, right? Go, go.
M6010_S0090_G0340_300_ys=......I've figured out the trick to her. Basically, let her say everything and then only question the doubtful points.\nThis is the best way.
M6010_S0090_G0350_300_ys=Her explanations are exhaustive, so that way is more efficient.
M6010_S0090_G0370_300_ys=I realized something! My sensory settings were, for some reason, recognizing the Operator-san's speech as noise!
M6010_S0090_G0380_300_ys=That's why it was hard to hear and I couldn't understand at all!\nBut I corrected it properly so it's fine now!
M6010_S0090_G0390_300_ys=I think we can get along well from now on!
M6010_S0090_G0400_300_op=Recently, he's become better at listening, so it's become very easy to work.
M6010_S0090_G0410_300_op=I've thought this for a while, but he can do it if he tries. That boy.
M6010_S0090_G0420_300_op=Haa...... Apparently he was treating my speech as noise until now......\nWell, it seems it's fine from now on, so whatever.
M6010_S0090_G0430_300_op=He's a good boy at heart, so I suppose I'll deal with him patiently.
M6010_S0090_G0440_300_ys=In the end, Eve was defeated without me sorting even once......\nI feel somewhat conflicted.
M6010_S0090_G0450_300_ys=Anyway, well, thanks.
M6010_S0090_G0460_300_op=If he was in perfect condition, Eve or whatever would have been one hit......\nBut well, all's well that ends well!
M6010_S0090_G0470_300_op=I'll adjust him properly to make it in time for the next sortie!
M6010_S0090_G0520_300_ys=Listen up you guys! Hammer the previous battle data of 2B and 9S into your heads!
M6010_S0090_G0530_300_ys=With this we are rock solid! Exterminate the Machine Lifeforms!
M6010_S0090_G0540_300_ys=We won't let your battle data go to waste!
M6010_S0090_G0550_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0090_G0560_300_ys=You guys are certainly amazing but......\nI feel like it's impossible for me......
M6010_S0090_G0570_300_ys=......But well, I guess I'll try my best a little.
M6010_S0090_G0580_300_ys=......Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0590_300_ys=It's not the Captain's battle data, is it.\nWell, it'll serve as a reference so it's fine.
M6010_S0090_G0600_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0610_300_op=I feel like this team has grown a little.\nMaybe it's about time they left my hands.
M6010_S0090_G0620_300_op=This team is safe now.
M6010_S0100_G0320_300_ys=...Sorry, someone needs to speak with me.
M6010_S0100_G0330_300_ys=Just get going, okay? I'll be right behind you.
M6010_S0100_G0340_300_ys=It's go time!
M6010_S0100_G0350_300_ys=I understand the plan and agree with it completely. Now we all just have to do our part!
M6010_S0100_G0360_300_ys=Let's be in this thing to win this thing!
M6010_S0100_G0370_300_ys=Thanks to my operator, I understand the plan perfectly.
M6010_S0100_G0380_300_op=I've done my part. Now it's in her hands.
M6010_S0100_G0390_300_op=...You know what? We make a pretty darn good team!
M6010_S0100_G0400_300_op=I've given her all the information I have. Now it's up to her.
M6010_S0100_G0410_300_op=I know she can do it... I know it!
M6010_S0100_G0420_300_ys=What do you mean, I can't head out yet? Find the problem and fix it already!
M6010_S0100_G0430_300_op=Uh-oh... These readings don't look good...
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0470_300_ys=Listen up, you lot! It's time to show me what you've learned!
M6010_S0100_G0480_300_ys=Glory to mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0490_300_ys=We'll make good use of your battle data.
M6010_S0100_G0500_300_ys=Glory to mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0510_300_ys=I owe everything to my commanding officer, so I'll do my best for her sake.
M6010_S0100_G0520_300_ys=Glory to mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0530_300_ys=Time to show them what we can do...
M6010_S0100_G0540_300_ys=Glory to mankind!
M6010_S0100_G0550_300_op=All we can do now is hope.
M6010_S0100_G0560_300_op=Glory to mankind!
