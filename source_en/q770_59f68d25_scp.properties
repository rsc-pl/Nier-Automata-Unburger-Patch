M5770_S0010_G0000_001_kj=Ah... you're with the YoRHa squad. Heard about you.
M5770_S0010_G0010_001_kj=I handle weapons here.
M5770_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What kind of weapons do you sell?
M5770_S0010_G0030_001_kj=Basically, I fix up old weapons from the past.
M5770_S0010_G0040_001_kj=Thing is, my tools are a bit broken right now.
M5770_S0010_G0050_001_kj=If I could just get the servicing device in this toolbox fixed, I could get back to selling and servicing weapons...
M5770_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=This is... pretty busted.
M5770_S0010_G0070_001_kj=Right? As you can see, I'm not so good at delicate work like device repair.
M5770_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Offer to help.
M5770_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Leave him to it.
M5770_S0010_G0100_001_kj=Phew... If this servicing device ain't fixed, I'm out of business.
M5770_S0010_G0110_001_kj=Whoa... Really? That'd be a huge help.
M5770_S0010_G0119_001_a9s=This servicing device has an internal short from being overloaded.
M5770_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Still, if we can find about four "Complex Machines," I think I can fix it.
M5770_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Is there anywhere we could find those around here?
M5770_S0010_G0140_001_kj=Ah... yeah, you can often find 'em near the center of the City Ruins, but that whole area's crawling with aggressive machines... It's too dangerous to get close.
M5770_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=The weapon shopkeeper said it was around here...
M5770_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Confirmed Machine Lifeforms. And they're hostile.
M5770_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5770_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Phew. We managed to take them down.
M5770_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Let's look around for those "Complex Machines" the weapon shopkeeper mentioned.
M5770_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=I think this is all of them. Let's go show the weapon shopkeeper.
M5770_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=...There. The servicing device is fully repaired.
M5770_S0030_G0010_001_kj=Whoa, thanks! Now I can finally open up shop.
M5770_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=That's great. I'm looking forward to it.
M5770_S0030_G0030_001_kj=You can count on me! I make weapons to protect my comrades.
M5770_S0030_G0040_001_kj=But, y'know... sometimes I wonder.
M5770_S0030_G0050_001_kj=I wonder if, by making these weapons, I'm just helping my comrades die faster...
M5770_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M5770_S0030_G0070_001_kj=Ah, my bad. Forget I said that, 'kay?
M5770_S0030_G0080_001_kj=Come again! I'll have some new weapons ready for you next time.
M5770_S0030_G0090_001_kj=Ah, it's you guys. You really saved me.
M5770_S0030_G0091_200_robocreator=Come to think of it, I forgot to give you your reward...
M5770_S0030_G0100_001_kj=As thanks for fixing my gear, take these enhancement materials.
M5770_S0030_G0101_300_robocreator=Wanna try upgrading something?
M5770_S0030_G0102_300_sele=Upgrade a weapon.
M5770_S0030_G0103_300_sele=Not now.
M5770_S0030_G0104_300_robocreator=If you ever need to talk weapons, just let me know.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=By the way, to repair and tune weapons, you need originals to work from, right? How do you get them in stock?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=By the way, how do you stock the prototype materials for making weapons?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=By the way, how do you stock the prototype materials for making weapons?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Ah, the owner of this shop sends them over.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=A woman named Accord is the owner here. I'm just watching the shop and helping with maintenance.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=I say owner, but she only wanders back once every few years. Usually she just sends weapons via delivery drone.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=Don't know where she gets 'em, but most of the weapons are in good shape.
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=If you ever happen to run into her out there, tell her I said hi.
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=Any weapons you buy can also be upgraded right here.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=It'll cost you money and materials, but it'll be worth the extra power. Plus, some weapons even get special abilities.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=Give it a shot if you feel like it.
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Alright, this weapon's been forged to Lv.3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=This is as far as I can take it... but I hear there's a master craftsman out there who can forge weapons to Lv.4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If I ever met a guy like that, I'd ask him to be my master.
