M3030_S0160_G0260_300_pascal=...Ah, hello there.\nThis is a nice place—quiet, with no one to bother you.
M3030_S0160_G0270_300_pascal=It'd be even better if there wasn't so much junk lying around, but\nno matter how much I pick up, there's always more, you see...
M3030_S0160_G0280_300_a2=Pascal... that's...
M3030_S0160_G0290_300_pascal=Pascal? That name sounds familiar somehow...
M3030_S0160_G0300_300_pascal=Oh, well. No matter.
M3030_S0160_G0310_300_pascal=If you'd like, why don't you have a look?
M3030_S0160_G0320_300_pascal=I can't imagine what use any of this stuff is, can you?\nI wonder who on earth just left it all here.
M3030_S0160_G0330_300_a2=...
M3030_S0160_G0340_300_pascal=This junk was just lying around, so I gathered it up.\nWould you be interested?
M3030_S0160_G0350_300_pascal=I really should get rid of all this trash soon.
M3030_S0160_G0380_300_a9s=Pascal... that's...
M3030_S0160_G0430_300_a9s=...
