M1080_S0090_G0000_201_a9s=...!
M1080_S0090_G0010_201_a9s=...
M1080_S0090_G0020_201_a9s=That just was... the words I heard on the Lunar Server.
M1080_S0090_G0030_201_a9s=Why...?
M1080_S0090_G0040_201_pod153=Report: Destruction of enemy Large-scale Weapon by 2B confirmed.
M1080_S0090_G0050_201_a9s=Ah... right.
M1080_S0090_G0060_201_a9s=Understood.
M1080_S0090_G0070_201_cmd=9S...
M1080_S0090_G0080_201_a9s=Commander?
M1080_S0090_G0090_201_cmd=...Sorry, but come to the Command Center.
M1080_S0090_G0100_201_a9s=...Roger that.
M1080_S0800_G0000_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0800_G0010_201_cmd=...Traces remained of you accessing the Main Server.
M1080_S0800_G0020_201_a9s=...I have something I want to ask about that. Commander.
M1080_S0800_G0030_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0800_G0040_201_a9s=Within the YoRHa Project, there were establishment records for the Council of Humanity on the Moon.
M1080_S0800_G0050_201_a9s=With this, the order is reversed.
M1080_S0800_G0060_201_a9s=It's almost as if... we, the YoRHa Squadron, created the Council of Humanity...
M1080_S0800_G0070_201_cmd=.........
M1080_S0800_G0080_201_cmd=...That is correct.
M1080_S0800_G0090_201_cmd=We installed the Council of Humanity server on the Moon.
M1080_S0800_G0100_201_a9s=Then...
M1080_S0800_G0110_201_cmd=Humanity is already gone.
M1080_S0800_G0120_201_a9s=!!
M1080_S0800_G0130_201_cmd=To speak accurately, humanity did not go to the moon.
M1080_S0800_G0140_201_cmd=Communications from the moon are nothing more than dummies prepared by a program.
M1080_S0800_G0150_201_cmd=What remains on the moon is just a small amount of human genetic information.
M1080_S0800_G0160_201_a9s=Why... such a thing.
M1080_S0800_G0170_201_cmd=...By the time the Aliens attacked, humanity had already gone extinct.
M1080_S0800_G0180_201_cmd=On this chip, all records are preserved.
M1080_S0800_G0190_201_cmd=If you are interested, you should take a look.
M1080_S0800_G0200_201_a9s=Why, give this to me...
M1080_S0800_G0210_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0850_H0000_201_cmd=No one can fight without a reason.
M1080_S0850_H0010_201_cmd=We require a God worth dedicating our lives to.
