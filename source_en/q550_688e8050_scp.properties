M5550_S0010_G0000_001_ys=You're... an old-model YoRHa unit...
M5550_S0010_G0010_001_ys=Well, not that it matters...
M5550_S0010_G0020_001_ys=You're... a YoRHa unit!? You survived?
M5550_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=...Yeah. I'm 9S.
M5550_S0010_G0031_001_ys=I've heard of you... You're the model they call Nines, right?
M5550_S0010_G0032_001_a9s=That's right.
M5550_S0010_G0040_001_ys=You did well to make it out... I'm 4S.
M5550_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=...Type-4s were the models deployed in the initial wave, weren't they.
M5550_S0010_G0060_001_4s=I never thought I'd meet another Scanner model...
M5550_S0010_G0070_001_4s=Especially after what happened to the Bunker.
M5550_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=...What are you doing out here?
M5550_S0010_G0090_001_4s=Gathering intelligence on the enemy.
M5550_S0010_G0100_001_4s=The YoRHa forces may have been wiped out, but the Resistance is still alive.
M5550_S0010_G0110_001_4s=As long as this body keeps moving, I want to be of use to someone...
M5550_S0010_G0120_001_4s=If you have any individual data on the enemy, would you mind sharing it? There's a limit to how much intel I can gather alone.
M5550_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=...Of course. I'll transfer the data I have on hand.
M5550_S0010_G0135_001_telo=Handed over Enemy Data.
M5550_S0010_G0140_001_4s=Thank you.
M5550_S0010_G0150_001_4s=If you get any new enemy data, let me know. We should share intel.
M5550_S0010_G0160_001_4s=If you encounter any new enemies, I'd appreciate the information.
M5550_S0010_G0170_001_4s=Oh, new enemy data? Thanks.
M5550_S0010_G0180_001_4s=It's probably a pain to keep coming back, so I don't mind if you wait until you've accumulated a decent amount.
M5550_S0020_G0030_001_4s=So you gathered some enemy data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0020_G0040_001_4s=Hmm... I see... yes...
M5550_S0020_G0050_001_4s=I've cross-referenced it with the data I've collected, and it seems that individual differences have started appearing among the robots recently.
M5550_S0020_G0060_001_4s=These differences seem to vary by region. It's like they're being influenced by their environment... Strange, isn't it? For robots.
M5550_S0020_G0070_001_4s=Ah, I should thank you properly. Here, take this.
M5550_S0020_G0080_001_4s=By the way... is it alright if I call you Nines, too? Like everyone else did.
M5550_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=It's fine. Not that there's anyone else left to call me that...
M5550_S0020_G0100_001_4s=I see... I'm sorry I asked.
M5550_S0030_G0020_001_4s=So you gathered some enemy data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0030_G0030_001_4s=I try my best, but I just can't cover all this ground on my own.
M5550_S0030_G0040_001_4s=That's why your help is a lifesaver, Nines. Thank you.
M5550_S0030_G0045_001_4s=Here, this is for you.
M5550_S0030_G0050_001_4s=Let me know when you've gathered more enemy data.
M5550_S0040_G0020_001_4s=So you gathered some enemy data for me. Thank you.
M5550_S0040_G0030_001_4s=Ah, this enemy... The data includes the one I fought alongside my comrades before.
M5550_S0040_G0040_001_4s=A long time ago, I had a lot of comrades, too. But they were taken out by that logic virus.
M5550_S0040_G0050_001_4s=I'd been injured in the battle just before and was in a dormant state, so I made it through...
M5550_S0040_G0060_001_4s=But now, none of them are left.
M5550_S0040_G0070_001_4s=...Sorry. I got a little sidetracked. Thanks for the data, Nines.
M5550_S0040_G0080_001_4s=Let me know when you've gathered more enemy data.
M5550_S0050_G0020_001_4s=You gathered the enemy data for me.
M5550_S0050_G0030_001_4s=Thanks to you, I was able to finish my collection 60% faster than scheduled. Another unit of the same model is reliable, after all.
M5550_S0050_G0040_001_4s=...How long are we going to keep doing this, I wonder.
M5550_S0050_G0050_001_4s=There's no place for us YoRHa to return to anymore...
M5550_S0050_G0060_001_a9s=...There must still be things we can do. Intelligence gathering is a legitimate form of combat support.
M5550_S0050_G0070_001_4s=I know. I know that!!
M5550_S0050_G0080_001_4s=...Sorry. There was no point in saying that to you, Nines.
M5550_S0050_G0090_001_4s=With this, the objective for enemy data collection is complete. Thank you so much for your cooperation.
M5550_S0050_G0100_001_4s=This belonged to a comrade... would you take it? I think they'd all be happy if you were the one to use it.
M5550_S0050_G0110_001_4s=Well then... You... Nines, don't ever have any regrets.
M5550_S0050_G0120_001_4s=I need to think about what to do from now on.
M5550_S0050_G0130_001_4s=...Thank you for everything.
