M5410_S0010_G0000_001_16d=Um... Are you 2B-san?
M5410_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=...I am.
M5410_S0010_G0020_001_16d=Oh, thank goodness. My name is 16D.
M5410_S0010_G0030_001_16d=Your wingman on the mission to the Abandoned Factory, 11B-san... she was my instructor.
M5410_S0010_G0040_001_16d=Um... Senpai... is she really...?
M5410_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=...Yes. She was shot down in that battle.
M5410_S0010_G0060_001_16d=Is that so... I'm sorry to hear that. Senpai was my idol.
M5410_S0010_G0070_001_16d=She was always so strong and cool...
M5410_S0010_G0080_001_16d=What happened to her body?
M5410_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=I haven't confirmed it.
M5410_S0010_G0100_001_16d=I know this is a rude request, but...
M5410_S0010_G0110_001_16d=if you happen to find any of Senpai's belongings, could you please give them to me?
M5410_S0010_G0120_001_16d=Of course, only when you have time.
M5410_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Accept.
M5410_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Refuse.
M5410_S0010_G0150_001_16d=...I see. I'm sorry to ask the impossible.
M5410_S0010_G0160_001_16d=When you have time again, please...
M5410_S0010_G0170_001_16d=If you find my Senpai 11B-san's belongings, would you be willing to give them to me?
M5410_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=...Understood.
M5410_S0010_G0185_001_16d=Thank you so much.
M5410_S0010_G0190_001_a2b=Pod. What's the status on 11B's Black Box signal?
M5410_S0010_G0200_001_pod042=Unknown: It has not been recovered to date.
M5410_S0010_G0210_001_a2b=She went down near the Abandoned Factory...
M5410_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=A YoRHa body...
M5410_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Affirmative: YoRHa Type B. The frame of 11B, the search target.
M5410_S0010_G0240_001_a2b=So this is where you fell, 11B...
M5410_S0010_G0250_001_a2b=Black Box signal?
M5410_S0010_G0260_001_pod042=Cannot be confirmed. Restoration is impossible due to fatal damage to the Black Box's main unit.
M5410_S0010_G0270_001_a2b=I see...
M5410_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Recommendation: Recover any usable weaponry.
M5410_S0010_G0290_001_pod042=Additionally, fragmentary memory data has been confirmed within the storage area.
M5410_S0010_G0300_001_a2b=A desertion plan...
M5410_S0010_G0320_001_pod042=A severe violation of regulations. However, due to the death of the unit in question, execution of punishment is impossible.
M5410_S0010_G0325_001_a2b=...
M5410_S0010_G0330_001_a2b=I'll give the weapon to 16D back at the Bunker.
M5410_S0020_G0000_001_16d=Ah... 2B-san.
M5410_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=I found 11B's body. This weapon is her memento.
M5410_S0020_G0015_001_telo=Handed over 11B's Memento.
M5410_S0020_G0020_001_16d=This weapon... there's a combat log. She was fighting right up until the moment of her death...
M5410_S0020_G0030_001_16d=That's just like my brave Senpai. Thank you so much.
M5410_S0020_G0040_001_16d=...I'm a Defense-type, so please, 2B-san, you should use this weapon.
M5410_S0020_G0050_001_16d=I think Senpai would be happier that way.
M5410_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=...Understood.
M5410_S0020_G0070_001_sele=Tell her about 11B's desertion plan.
M5410_S0020_G0080_001_sele=Keep 11B's desertion plan a secret.
M5410_S0020_G0090_001_a2b=Actually, this information was in 11B's memory banks...
M5410_S0020_G0100_001_16d=This is... desertion? *That* Senpai?
M5410_S0020_G0110_001_16d=Heh...
M5410_S0020_G0120_001_16d=Heh heh... hahaha...
M5410_S0020_G0130_001_a2b=What's so funny?
M5410_S0020_G0140_001_16d=I mean, a Senpai who was so strict trying to desert... Heh.
M5410_S0020_G0150_001_16d=And on top of that, to die in such a miserable way.
M5410_S0020_G0160_001_16d=She finally got what she deserved for tormenting me so much...
M5410_S0020_G0170_001_16d=Looking down on me just because I wasn't an Attack-model...
M5410_S0020_G0180_001_16d=Ah, 2B-san. Thank you so much!
M5410_S0020_G0190_001_16d=Now I can finally focus on my work and enjoy it!
M5410_S0020_G0200_001_a2b=...
M5410_S0020_G0210_001_16d=Is this all the information on Senpai...?
M5410_S0020_G0220_001_a2b=...Yes.
M5410_S0020_G0230_001_16d=I'm sure Senpai can rest in peace now.
M5410_S0020_G0240_001_16d=...
M5410_S0020_G0250_001_16d=Actually, I... was dating Senpai.
M5410_S0020_G0260_001_16d=She used to say things like, "I'll protect you."
M5410_S0020_G0270_001_16d=But if she's dead, there's no way for her to protect me, is there?
M5410_S0020_G0280_001_16d=I'm... thinking of transferring to an Attack-type, like Senpai and you, 2B-san.
M5410_S0020_G0290_001_16d=So I can avenge my Senpai.
M5410_S0020_G0300_001_a2b=...Is that so.
M5410_S0020_G0310_001_16d=Thank you for everything.
M5410_S0020_G0320_001_16d=Ah, please take this as my thanks.
M5410_S0020_G0330_001_16d=I don't have a reason to protect myself anymore, after all...
