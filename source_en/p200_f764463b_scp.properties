M1060_S0120_G0000_101_pascal=That giant machine lifeform is a weapon that was discarded in the past.
M1060_S0120_G0010_101_pascal=It was developed to annihilate androids, but it became uncontrollable...
M1060_S0120_G0020_101_pascal=At the time, I was also part of the machine lifeform network, so I remember it...
M1060_S0120_G0030_101_pascal=As soon as it made landfall, it went berserk and started attacking friend and foe alike.
M1060_S0120_G0040_101_pascal=But in the end, we were unable to stop its rampage either...
M1060_S0120_G0050_101_pascal=It was dumped into the deep sea, but it seems it's trying to come ashore again.
M1060_S0120_G0060_101_a2b=I see...
M1060_S0120_G0070_101_a9s=...2B!
M1060_S0120_G0080_101_a9s=I just had an idea!
M1060_S0120_G0090_101_a9s=Please hold off the monster here!
M1060_S0120_G0100_101_a2b=...What!?
M1060_S0120_G0110_101_a9s=I'm counting on you!
M1060_S0120_G0120_101_pod042=Report: 9S has withdrawn from the front line.
M1060_S0120_G0130_101_pod042=Proposal: Register him with Command as a deserter.
M1060_S0120_G0140_101_a2b=No!
M1060_S0120_G0150_101_a2b=...I'm sure 9S has a plan.
M1060_S0120_G0160_101_a9s=2B!
M1060_S0120_G0170_101_a9s=I'm going to see if I can use the missiles that were meant to be loaded onto the aircraft carrier.
M1060_S0120_G0180_101_a9s=So the controls don't get jammed...
M1060_S0120_G0190_101_a9s=destroy the EMP attack unit on the enemy's back!
M1060_S0120_G0200_101_a2b=Roger.
