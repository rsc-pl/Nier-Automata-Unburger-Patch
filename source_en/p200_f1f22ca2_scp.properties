M1080_S0030_G0000_300_pascal=2B-san, where are you going? The Machine Lifeforms \nwho want to form an alliance are inside the Abandoned Factory.
M1080_S0030_G0480_101_pascal=The Machine Lifeforms wishing to form an alliance should be further inside.
M1080_S0030_G0490_101_pascal=However, please be careful.
M1080_S0030_G0500_101_pascal=We Machine Lifeforms are dangerous, after all.
M1080_S0030_G0510_101_a2b=You... are dangerous?
M1080_S0030_G0520_101_pascal=Yes, that is an objective fact.
M1080_S0030_G0530_101_pascal=Having disconnected from the network, we no longer share information with one another.
M1080_S0030_G0540_101_pascal=Even if we exchange words, they might not reflect our true intentions.
M1080_S0030_G0550_101_a2b=...Words, huh.
M1080_S0040_S0000_101_n02=Welcome. To the place where God dwells.
M1080_S0050_G0000_101_n02=We have become aware of the existence of God.
M1080_S0050_G0010_101_n02=Under the name of God, all existence must be equal.
M1080_S0050_G0020_101_n02=The Founder wishes to form a peace treaty with you.
M1080_S0050_G0030_101_n02=We priests shall guide you. This way, to the room in the back.
M1080_S0050_G0040_101_pascal=Just as I predicted... a very suspicious group indeed...
M1080_S0050_G0050_101_a2b=Then why did you come along?
M1080_S0050_G0050_300_n02=Please stop!! We have no intention of fighting!!
M1080_S0050_G0060_101_pascal=Since I was the one who introduced you to this place, 2B-san...
M1080_S0050_G0060_300_pascal=Please calm down! We came here for peace negotiations...
M1080_S0050_G0070_101_pascal=I feel it's my responsibility to see this through to the end.
M1080_S0050_G0080_101_a2b=...For what it's worth, thank you.
M1080_S0050_G0090_101_prst=Please proceed through this passageway.
M1080_S0050_G0100_101_prst=To reach the Founder's room, please take this elevator.
M1080_S0050_G0100_300_pascal=For now, let's at least hear what they have to say.
M1080_S0050_G0111_101_prst=No matter how much you hurry, the Founder will not run away.
