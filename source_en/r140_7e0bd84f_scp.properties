M3030_S0160_G0270_300_pascal=It would be even better if not for all this junk lying around, but\nno matter how much I pick up, it never runs out, you see...
M3030_S0160_G0280_300_a2=Pascal... that is...

M3030_S0160_G0300_300_pascal=Well, whatever.
M3030_S0160_G0310_300_pascal=If you like, won't you take a look?
M3030_S0160_G0320_300_pascal=You wouldn't know what use things like this have, right?\nI wonder who in the world abandoned them here.
M3030_S0160_G0330_300_a2=...
M3030_S0160_G0340_300_pascal=It was lying around as junk, so I collected it.\nHow is it?
M3030_S0160_G0350_300_pascal=I really must dispose of this trash quickly.
M3030_S0160_G0380_300_a9s=Pascal... that is...
M3030_S0160_G0430_300_a9s=...
