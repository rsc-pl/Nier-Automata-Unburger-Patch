M5032_S0030_G0000_001_eng=I Am A Little Tired... I Will Sleep...
M5032_S0030_G0010_001_eng=Hello, Androids.
M5032_S0030_G0020_001_eng=I Am Bored. Tell Me A Story.
M5032_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=A story...
M5032_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=A lot of our information is classified, so we can't.
M5032_S0030_G0050_001_eng=A Story Of The Past Is Fine.
M5032_S0030_G0060_001_eng=What Kind Of City Was This?
M5032_S0030_G0070_001_a9s="What kind..."
M5032_S0030_G0080_001_a2b=Many humans lived here... a great many.
M5032_S0030_G0090_001_eng=Many... Humans.
M5032_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=And you were the ones who drove them out...
M5032_S0030_G0110_001_eng=When I Was Manufactured, Humans Were Already Gone.
M5032_S0030_G0120_001_eng=All I Know Are These Ruins, And Androids.
M5032_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=That doesn't mean your sin is forgiven...
M5032_S0030_G0140_001_eng=We Machine Lifeforms Cannot Understand The Concept Of Sin.
M5032_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=...Let's go, 2B.
M5032_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=Understood.
M5032_S0030_G0170_001_eng=Hello. Thanks For Before.
M5032_S0030_G0180_001_a2b=How are you doing?
M5032_S0030_G0190_001_eng="So-so"... Is How I Feel.
M5032_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=...A strange way to put it.
M5032_S0030_G0210_001_eng=I Was Bored, So I Was Reading Humanity's Records.
M5032_S0030_G0220_001_eng=And, I Have A Question.
M5032_S0030_G0230_001_a2b=A question?
M5032_S0030_G0240_001_eng=What Is "Night"?
M5032_S0030_G0250_001_a2b=...Night?
M5032_S0030_G0260_001_a9s=Ah, that was an environmental change from long ago. It's in the records.
M5032_S0030_G0270_001_a9s=The sun is out all day now, but in the past, the sky was dark for half the day.
M5032_S0030_G0280_001_a9s=Apparently, it resembled the view from the Bunker.
M5032_S0030_G0290_001_a2b=Is that so.
M5032_S0030_G0300_001_eng=Stars... I Would Like To See Them... Someday...
M5032_S0030_G0310_001_eng=...
M5032_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=What's wrong? You don't have much energy for a Machine Lifeform.
M5032_S0030_G0330_001_eng=It Seems... The Lifespan Of My Machine... Is Approaching.
M5032_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=I see. And you want us to repair you? Such a selfish request...
M5032_S0030_G0350_001_eng=No... It Is Fine.
M5032_S0030_G0360_001_a9s=Huh?
M5032_S0030_G0370_001_eng=I Was Thinking About The "Sin"...
M5032_S0030_G0380_001_eng=That You Mentioned...
M5032_S0030_G0390_001_eng=It Is True... I Have... Killed...
M5032_S0030_G0400_001_eng=Many Androids.
M5032_S0030_G0410_001_eng=I Did Not Understand While I Was Connected... To The Network...
M5032_S0030_G0420_001_eng=But Now, I Can Understand... That For You All...
M5032_S0030_G0430_001_eng=It Was Painful...
M5032_S0030_G0440_001_eng=Sins Must Be Atoned For.
M5032_S0030_G0450_001_a9s=That is...
M5032_S0030_G0460_001_eng=When I Die...
M5032_S0030_G0470_001_eng=You Should Extract My Materials... And Reuse Them.
M5032_S0030_G0480_001_eng=Goodbye... Androids...
M5032_S0030_G0490_001_a9s=Ah...!
M5032_S0030_G0500_001_a2b=...
M5032_S0030_G0510_001_a9s=To choose death on his own...
M5032_S0030_G0520_001_a2b=We're the same.
M5032_S0030_G0530_001_a9s=Huh?
M5032_S0030_G0540_001_a2b=We've destroyed massive numbers of Machine Lifeforms in the same way.
M5032_S0030_G0550_001_a2b=If someone asked us if that was a sin...
M5032_S0030_G0560_001_a9s=2B...
M5032_S0030_G0570_001_a9s=It's broken... Its lifespan must have run out...
M5032_S0030_G0580_001_eng=Commencing Automated Defense.
M5032_S0030_G0590_001_eng=As Expected Of YoRHa... You Got Me...
