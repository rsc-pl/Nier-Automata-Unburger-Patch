M1060_S0005_G0100_001_a2b=9S. Why did you ask Pascal for information on A2?
M1060_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=Eh...?
M1060_S0005_G0120_001_a2b=Accessing Machine Lifeforms without\npermission from Command is not recommended...
M1060_S0005_G0130_001_a9s=...Yeah... I'm sorry.
M1060_S0005_G0140_001_a2b=...But, I don't dislike that curiosity-filled side of yours.
M1060_S0005_G0150_001_a9s=...
M1060_S0005_G0160_001_a9s=Thank you, 2B.
M1060_S0005_G0161_001_a2b=Our enemies are the Machine Lifeforms, so don't forget that.
M1060_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Ah, 2B. You came at just the right time.
M1060_S0010_G0010_001_ane=Actually, there is an aircraft carrier our Android Army has deployed in the Pacific...
M1060_S0010_G0020_001_ane=It will be returning soon for resupply.
M1060_S0010_G0030_001_ane=We of the Resistance will also assist with the resupply operation.
M1060_S0010_G0040_001_ane=I'd like to ask you two to escort it as well.
M1060_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Escort?
M1060_S0010_G0060_001_ane=Yeah. Supply missiles have been prepared along the coast,
M1060_S0010_G0070_001_ane=But the Machine Lifeforms have been intensifying their activities lately, so I thought it better to stay alert.
M1060_S0010_G0080_001_ane=Of course, if you have orders from the YoRHa squadron, I don't mind if you prioritize those.
M1060_S0010_G0090_001_ane=I'm counting on you.
M5920_S0100_G0200_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B-san. It is time for regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0210_001_a2b=This is 2B. No problems.
M5920_S0100_G0220_001_op60=Listen, 2B-san. I was looking at image data of flowers today, and...
M5920_S0100_G0230_001_a2b=Flowers?
M5920_S0100_G0240_001_op60=Yes. Among the few materials recorded in the Bunker, there is a flower called the "Lunar Tear"...
M5920_S0100_G0250_001_op60=I think if you made this into a hair ornament or something, it would suit the cool 2B-san very well~
M5920_S0100_G0260_001_a2b=Not necessary.
M5920_S0100_G0270_001_op60=Now, now, don't say that. Being fashionable is a girl's etiquette.
M5920_S0100_G0280_001_op60=If I discover anything else cute, I will report it to you, 2B-san.
M5920_S0100_G0290_001_a2b=I don't need that kind of info...
M5920_S0100_G0300_001_op60=That is all from Operator 6O. See you!
M5920_S0100_G0310_001_a2b=...
M5920_S0100_G0470_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. Conducting regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0480_001_a9s=Yes, yes. No abnormalities here~
M5920_S0100_G0490_001_op210=Roger. Also, I am conveying personal praise directly from the Commander\nregarding the recent activities of YoRHa unit 9S.
M5920_S0100_G0500_001_op210=Consequently, it is said that increased production of \nthe Number 9 Model is being considered.
M5920_S0100_G0510_001_a9s=Heeh... Is that so. I'm happy.
M5920_S0100_G0520_001_a9s=This result is also only because of your support, \nOperator-san. You're calm, and a beauty...
M5920_S0100_G0530_001_op210=Flattery is unnecessary.
M5920_S0100_G0540_001_op210=That is all.
M5920_S0100_G0550_001_a9s=It wasn't flattery, though...
