M5652_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, if it's the Resistance member who was here, he went outside.
M5652_S0010_G0010_001_resiman=Something about going to hand over cargo at the stationing area near the desert...
M5652_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=But, he hasn't come back even though it's largely past schedule.
M5652_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=If it's okay, could you go check on him when you go nearby?
M5652_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Go check on him.
M5652_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Refuse.
M5652_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=Mu... I see. Tell me if you feel like it.
M5652_S0010_G0070_001_resiman=Hey, won't you go check on the guy who went to deliver cargo to the desert?
M5652_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=Thank you. That saves me.
M5652_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=He should have gone to meet the Resistance woman in the desert. Counting on you.
M5652_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=He should have gone to the desert for cargo handover. Counting on you.
M5652_S0020_G0000_001_jackas=Eh? The man who brought cargo? ...Ah, he definitely came though.
M5652_S0020_G0010_001_jackas=The cargo was a broken water purifier, but repairs are finished and I delivered it.
M5652_S0020_G0020_001_jackas=I took it to the repository with him but... he hasn't returned yet?
M5652_S0020_G0030_001_jackas=To keep the enemy from stealing it, we're placing it all in a certain place in the City Ruins.
M5652_S0020_G0040_001_jackas=I wonder if he's around there? I'll tell you the location.
M5652_S0020_G0050_001_jackas=If it's him, I wonder if he's at the repository in the Great City Ruins.
M5652_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=This is the materials the Resistance is storing, huh...
M5652_S0020_G0070_001_resiman=...me...
M5652_S0020_G0080_001_resiman=me... help mee
M5652_S0020_G0090_001_pod153=Confirmed sound effects thought to be emitted from vocal cords within cargo.
M5652_S0020_G0100_001_a2=This is the materials the Resistance is storing, huh...
M5652_S0020_G0110_001_resiman=...me...
M5652_S0020_G0120_001_resiman=me... help mee
M5652_S0020_G0130_001_pod042=Confirmed sound effects thought to be emitted from vocal cords within cargo.
M5652_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=Sa... Saved... Thank you...
M5652_S0030_G0001_001_resiman=It's bad of me to ask, but could you make it so I can pass through to the exit?
M5652_S0030_G0002_001_resiman=I hurt my leg trying to force my way out...
M5652_S0030_G0003_001_resiman=Besides, as you can see my body is big... Make it wide, please.
M5652_S0030_G0010_001_resiman=Actually, I got trapped while organizing the cargo...
M5652_S0030_G0020_001_resiman=The Senpai who came with me threw cargo in so violently, I got caught up in it.
M5652_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=I can't follow that Senpai anym...
M5652_S0030_G0040_001_jackas=HEY YOUUUUUUU!!
M5652_S0030_G0050_001_jackas=Just when I thought I hadn't seen you for a while, what are you slacking off for!
M5652_S0030_G0060_001_jackas=I should have taught you the know-how of material management!
M5652_S0030_G0070_001_resiman=Even if you say know-how, because Senpai threw the cargo violently, I was trapped...
M5652_S0030_G0080_001_jackas=You can manage something like that if you blow it away with a bomb!
M5652_S0030_G0090_001_resiman=I don't have something like a bomb...
M5652_S0030_G0100_001_jackas=You can make a bomb immediately with materials around here. It's the basics of basics!
M5652_S0030_G0110_001_resiman=That's impossible...
M5652_S0030_G0120_001_jackas=There's no possible or impossible! Starting now, we're redoing it from the basics of bomb production!
M5652_S0030_G0130_001_resiman=Eeeeh!? I'm in charge of material management, something violent like that...
M5652_S0030_G0140_001_jackas=Ha ha! Material management must be experts who can break through any situation!
M5652_S0030_G0150_001_jackas=Sorry. My incompetent junior caused you trouble.
M5652_S0030_G0160_001_jackas=Here, an apology. Accept it.
M5652_S0030_G0170_001_jackas=See ya... take care.
M5652_S0030_G0180_001_jackas=Because from now on, I have to teach this guy bomb making all night long.
M5652_S0030_G0190_001_resiman=Eeeeh! No way!?
