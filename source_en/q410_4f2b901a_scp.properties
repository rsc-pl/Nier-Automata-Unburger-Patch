M5410_S0010_G0000_001_16d=Um... are you 2B-san?
M5410_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=...I am.
M5410_S0010_G0020_001_16d=Ah, thank goodness. My name is 16D.
M5410_S0010_G0030_001_16d=When you sortied to the Abandoned Factory, your wingman 11B-san was my instructor.
M5410_S0010_G0040_001_16d=Umm... did Senpai...
M5410_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=...Yeah. She was shot down in that battle.
M5410_S0010_G0060_001_16d=Is that so... that is regrettable. Senpai was my idol.
M5410_S0010_G0070_001_16d=She was always strong and cool...
M5410_S0010_G0080_001_16d=What happened to her remains?
M5410_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=I haven't confirmed.
M5410_S0010_G0100_001_16d=I apologize for the rude request, but...
M5410_S0010_G0110_001_16d=If you happen to find Senpai's mementos, could you please give them to me?
M5410_S0010_G0120_001_16d=Of course, only when you have time.
M5410_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Accept.
M5410_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Refuse.
M5410_S0010_G0150_001_16d=...I see. Sorry for asking the impossible.
M5410_S0010_G0160_001_16d=If you have time again, please...
M5410_S0010_G0170_001_16d=If you find my Senpai 11B-san's mementos, won't you give them to me?
M5410_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=...Understood.
M5410_S0010_G0185_001_16d=Thank you very much.
M5410_S0010_G0190_001_a2b=Pod. What about 11B's Black Box signal?
M5410_S0010_G0200_001_pod042=Unknown: It has not been recovered to date.
M5410_S0010_G0210_001_a2b=She fell near the Abandoned Factory...
M5410_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=A YoRHa corpse...
M5410_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Confirmation: YoRHa Type B. The frame of 11B under search.
M5410_S0010_G0240_001_a2b=You fell in a place like this, huh. 11B...
M5410_S0010_G0250_001_a2b=The Black Box signal?
M5410_S0010_G0260_001_pod042=Cannot confirm. Restoration is impossible due to fatal damage to the Black Box main unit.
M5410_S0010_G0270_001_a2b=I see...
M5410_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Recommendation: Recover usable weaponry.
M5410_S0010_G0290_001_pod042=Also, confirmed fragmentary memory data within the memory region.
M5410_S0010_G0300_001_a2b=A desertion plan...
M5410_S0010_G0320_001_pod042=Severe violation of regulations. However, due to the death of the unit in question, execution of punishment is impossible.
M5410_S0010_G0325_001_a2b=...
M5410_S0010_G0330_001_a2b=I'll give the weapon to 16D in the Bunker.
M5410_S0020_G0000_001_16d=Ah... 2B-san.
M5410_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=I found 11B's remains. This weapon is her memento.
M5410_S0020_G0015_001_telo=Handed over 11B's Memento.
M5410_S0020_G0020_001_16d=This weapon... has a combat usage log. She was fighting until the moment of her death...
M5410_S0020_G0030_001_16d=That's just like my brave Senpai. Thank you very much.
M5410_S0020_G0040_001_16d=...I am a defense type, so please use this weapon yourself, 2B-san.
M5410_S0020_G0050_001_16d=I think Senpai would be happier that way.
M5410_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=...Understood.
M5410_S0020_G0070_001_sele=Tell her about 11B's desertion plan.
M5410_S0020_G0080_001_sele=Keep 11B's desertion plan a secret.
M5410_S0020_G0090_001_a2b=Actually, this information was in 11B's memory area...
M5410_S0020_G0100_001_16d=This is... desertion? That Senpai?
M5410_S0020_G0110_001_16d=Kuh...
M5410_S0020_G0120_001_16d=Kufu... Fufufufu.
M5410_S0020_G0130_001_a2b=What's funny?
M5410_S0020_G0140_001_16d=I mean, that Senpai who was so strict, trying to desert... Fufu.
M5410_S0020_G0150_001_16d=And to die in such a miserable way.
M5410_S0020_G0160_001_16d=Punishment has fallen on her for tormenting me so much...
M5410_S0020_G0170_001_16d=Looking down on me just because I wasn't an attack model...
M5410_S0020_G0180_001_16d=Ah, 2B-san. Thank you very much!
M5410_S0020_G0190_001_16d=With this, I can happily focus on my work!
M5410_S0020_G0200_001_a2b=...
M5410_S0020_G0210_001_16d=Is this all the information on Senpai...?
M5410_S0020_G0220_001_a2b=...Yes.
M5410_S0020_G0230_001_16d=I think Senpai can rest in peace with this.
M5410_S0020_G0240_001_16d=...
M5410_S0020_G0250_001_16d=Actually, I... was dating Senpai.
M5410_S0020_G0260_001_16d="I will protect you"... she used to say things like that.
M5410_S0020_G0270_001_16d=But if she dies, there's no way to protect me, right.
M5410_S0020_G0280_001_16d=I... am thinking of converting to an attack type like Senpai and 2B-san.
M5410_S0020_G0290_001_16d=In order to avenge Senpai's enemy.
M5410_S0020_G0300_001_a2b=...Is that so.
M5410_S0020_G0310_001_16d=Thank you for everything.
M5410_S0020_G0320_001_16d=Ah, please take this as thanks.
M5410_S0020_G0330_001_16d=Because I don't have a reason to protect myself anymore...
