M1060_S0005_G0000_001_pascal=9S-san. What is the matter? You said you wanted to speak directly.
M1060_S0005_G0010_001_a9s=It's faster to have you look at the actual records than talking about it...
M1060_S0005_G0020_001_sele=Initiate data transfer.
M1060_S0005_G0030_001_sele=Do not transfer data.
M1060_S0005_G0040_001_pascal=...I see.
M1060_S0005_G0050_001_pascal=This android named "A2" is indeed in our past records as well.
M1060_S0005_G0060_001_pascal=We recognize it as a dangerous android, but...
M1060_S0005_G0070_001_pascal=It never comes directly to this village.
M1060_S0005_G0080_001_pascal=I am sorry. That is about all the information I know.
M1060_S0005_G0090_001_a9s=I see... Thank you.
M1060_S0005_G0170_001_a2b=Let's return to the Resistance Camp for now while keeping watch on the area.
M1060_S0005_G0180_001_a2b=We need to check our Ego Data and resupply.
