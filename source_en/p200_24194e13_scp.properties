M1050_S0115_S0000_201_eve=Hey... Nii-chan. Why are you reading a book?
M1050_S0115_S0010_201_adam=Because knowledge enriches a person.
M1050_S0115_S0020_201_eve=Can't you just transfer the data?
M1050_S0115_S0030_201_adam=If you don't read it yourself, it won't enter your heart.
M1050_S0115_S0040_201_eve=...Okay.
M1050_S0115_S0050_201_eve=...
M1050_S0115_S0060_201_eve=...Hey, Nii-chan.
M1050_S0115_S0070_201_adam=What is it?
M1050_S0115_S0080_201_eve=My name, Eve... it says here it's a girl's name.
M1050_S0115_S0090_201_eve=Shouldn't our names be somethin' like "Cain and Abel"?
M1050_S0115_S0100_201_adam=Humans do not change their names so easily.
M1050_S0115_S0110_201_adam=Take pride in your name... Eve.
M1050_S0115_S0120_201_eve=...Okay.
M1050_S0115_S0130_201_eve=If you say so, Nii-chan, then I'm fine with being Eve.
M1050_S0115_S0140_201_adam=Good boy.
M1050_S0115_S0150_201_eve=...Hey, Nii-chan.
M1050_S0115_S0160_201_adam=What is it?
M1050_S0115_S0170_201_eve=When you're done reading that, let's go play.
M1050_S0115_S0180_201_eve=I bet it'll be super fun.
M1050_S0115_S0190_201_adam=...I don't mind. But only after you've read your book.
M1050_S0115_S0200_201_eve=Really!?
M1050_S0115_S0210_201_eve=Okay, I'll try my best to read it!
M1050_S0115_S0220_201_eve=I'll work really hard and read it!
M1050_S0115_S0230_201_adam=Yes... Do that.
