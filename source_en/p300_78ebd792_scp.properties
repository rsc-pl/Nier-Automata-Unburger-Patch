M3030_S0020_G0000_001_pascal=Hmm...
M3030_S0020_G0010_001_pascal="Where the state ceases—there only begins the man who is not superfluous," is it...?
M3030_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=Hmm.
M3030_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=The thoughts of this human named Nietzsche are quite profound.
M3030_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=So profound that, to me, he still just seems like an eccentric... but...
M3030_S0020_G0050_001_pascal=Well then...
M3030_S0020_G0060_001_pascal=I suppose I must look around this world myself, and not just through books...
M3030_S0020_G0070_001_child=Hey, hey! Uncle Pascal! Play with uuuus!
M3030_S0020_G0080_001_children=Play with uuuus!
M3030_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=Oh my, oh my. You've all become quite good at speaking.
M3030_S0020_G0100_001_pascal=But you aren't finished with your studies yet, are you?
M3030_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=We promised that today you would read and memorize the plant encyclopedia, didn't we?
M3030_S0020_G0120_001_child=So, when we're done studying, will you play with uuuus?
M3030_S0020_G0130_001_children=Will you play with uuuus?
M3030_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=Of course I'll play with you.
M3030_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=Uncle Pascal doesn't tell lies, you know.
M3030_S0020_G0160_001_pascal=Children who tell lies turn into bad Machine Lifeforms, you know?
M3030_S0020_G0170_001_child=Eek!
M3030_S0020_G0180_001_children=Eek!
M3030_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=...Hm? What is that?
