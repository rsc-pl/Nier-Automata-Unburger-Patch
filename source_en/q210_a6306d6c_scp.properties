M5210_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Ah... you guys are androids...
M5210_S0010_G0010_001_n02=That means you came to kill me...
M5210_S0010_G0020_001_n02=I've lived enough already, but if you're going to kill me don't make it too painful.
M5210_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Destroy.
M5210_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Do not destroy.
M5210_S0010_G0050_001_n02=Get it over with...
M5210_S0010_G0060_001_n02=...Why don't you kill?
M5210_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=...Because you have no will to fight.
M5210_S0010_G0080_001_a2b=Like the Machine Lifeforms at Pascal's place.
M5210_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=If you do not cause us harm, there is no reason to destroy you either.
M5210_S0010_G0100_001_n02=You met Pascal? I see...
M5210_S0010_G0110_001_n02=But, be careful okay?
M5210_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=Of what?
M5210_S0010_G0130_001_n02=Among Machine Lifeforms there are guys who rage out of control.
M5210_S0010_G0140_001_n02=They attack without caring about friend or foe.
M5210_S0010_G0150_001_n02=In the valley ahead, guys like that are prowling.
M5210_S0010_G0160_001_n02=Unless it's something urgent, don't get close...
M5210_S0010_G0170_001_a2b=Machine Lifeforms that attack indiscriminately...
M5210_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Recommendation: Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms.
M5210_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Machine Lifeform corpses... is it a graveyard?
M5210_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Be careful! They're still alive.
M5210_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Yes!
M5210_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=There are still more!
M5210_S0020_G0040_001_n02=Kill... Kill...
M5210_S0020_G0050_001_n02=It hurts... Kill me...
M5210_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=It's saying... something.
M5210_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=2B! Don't let your guard down!
M5210_S0020_G0080_001_n02=Kill me...
M5210_S0020_G0090_001_n02=Kill... Kill... me.
M5210_S0020_G0100_001_n02=Please kill me.
M5210_S0020_G0110_001_a2b=Just what is this thing...
M5210_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=It was talking...
M5210_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=Shall we ask the Machine Lifeform who told us about this place?
M5210_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=She might know some information.
M5210_S0030_G0000_001_n02=Ah... it's you guys.
M5210_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=About the Machine Lifeforms in the valley ahead...
M5210_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Ah, those guys are dangerous so don't get close...
M5210_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=It's okay now. We defeated them all.
M5210_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Eeh!?
M5210_S0030_G0050_001_n02=...Is that so. Then, can those guys go to the place called Heaven too?
M5210_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=Heaven?
M5210_S0030_G0070_001_n02=Recently, there are many Machine Lifeforms jumping into that valley.
M5210_S0030_G0080_001_n02=Among them are guys who hurt themselves and try to break.
M5210_S0030_G0090_001_n02=Guys who died like that, and guys who failed to die are gathering in that valley.
M5210_S0030_G0100_001_n02=I don't really understand why they do such things but.
M5210_S0030_G0110_001_n02=I am praying here so their souls can go to Heaven.
M5210_S0030_G0120_001_n02=...This is thanks.
M5210_S0030_G0130_001_n02=Thank you, for killing them.
M5210_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Praying so souls can go to Heaven... huh.
M5210_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=I wonder if such a thing exists?
M5210_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=...Surely, we will understand when we are annihilated from this world.
M5210_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=Us too.
M5210_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=...That's true.
