M5031_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=2B, wait a second.
M5031_S0020_G0000_300_a2b=We're not having much luck gathering materials...
M5031_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Hm?
M5031_S0020_G0010_300_a9s=Should we ask the Operator?
M5031_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=This Machine Lifeform is still alive.
M5031_S0020_G0020_300_a9s=Operator-san, there's something I'd like to ask.\nWe're looking for a "Pristine Screw." Do you happen to know where we could get one?
M5031_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=Then, let's destroy it...
M5031_S0020_G0030_300_op210=In that case, there are records of them being obtained from Large Bipedal Machine Lifeforms.
M5031_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=No, I don't think that's necessary.
M5031_S0020_G0040_300_a9s=That's a big help.
M5031_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Its drive components are destroyed, so there's no danger of it attacking.
M5031_S0020_G0050_300_a2b=Large Biped... I think they were in the Desert Zone...
M5031_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=If we examine it, we might find something interesting.
M5031_S0020_G0060_300_a9s=Let's go.
M5031_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=...I see. Shall we try repairing its brain circuits a bit?
M5031_S0020_G0070_300_a2b=...We're not having much luck gathering materials.
M5031_S0020_G0080_001_a2b=Repair it? Why?
M5031_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=To get information on other Machine Lifeforms.\nI think it's worth a shot, don't you?
M5031_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=Understood. If that's what you think, 9S.
M5031_S0020_G0100_300_a2b=Now is not the time to be repairing this thing.
M5031_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=The only problem is, we're short on parts. If we just had a "Pristine Screw"...
M5031_S0020_G0120_001_a2b=A new screw... We might be able to get one from enemy wreckage.
M5031_S0020_G0125_001_a9s=Pod, search for the locations of any relevant enemies.
M5031_S0020_G0130_001_a2b=Still, repairing a Machine Lifeform we're supposed to destroy... It's a complicated feeling.
M5031_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=You can never have too much information, 2B.
M5031_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=With this screw, we can repair that large Machine Lifeform.
M5031_S0030_G0005_001_telo=47 minutes later...
M5031_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=Okay, with this... how's that!?
M5031_S0030_G0020_001_eng=I... am... Engels... 110...
M5031_S0030_G0030_001_eng=Ma...nufactu...red...
M5031_S0030_G0040_001_eng=Curre...nt... stat...us...
M5031_S0030_G0090_001_a2b=...It spoke?
M5031_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=It seems like some kind of data is being played back.
M5031_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=But Machine Lifeforms don't have consciousness, you know.
M5031_S0030_G0120_001_a2b=...
M5031_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Also, I was able to extract some data, though it's fragmented.
M5031_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Apparently, it's information about the factory where this robot was made.
M5031_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=I'll save it in a readable format.
M5031_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=Is this all the information?
M5031_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=No.
M5031_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=It seems... we're still missing some parts.
M5031_S0030_G0190_001_a9s=To connect the memory regions, I'd like to get four "Pristine Screws" and a "Large Gear."
M5031_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Understood.
M5540_S0030_G0400_001_op210=This is 21O. What is it?
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location info obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location info obtained. Marking on map.
