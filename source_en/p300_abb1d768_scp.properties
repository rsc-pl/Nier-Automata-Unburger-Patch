M3000_S0040_G0000_001_op210=...Those are your orders. Understood?
M3000_S0040_G0000_300_op210=We believe the target is located somewhere high with a good signal. \nPlease check the rooftops of buildings and other such locations.
M3000_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Ummm...
M3000_S0040_G0010_300_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0020_001_a9s=Our scanner units are to paralyze the enemy's anti-air system via hacking in preparation for the main assault.
M3000_S0040_G0020_300_op210=Whatever you do, do not destroy the target. \nEven if you do, a replacement will just appear after a while, so there's no point.
M3000_S0040_G0030_001_op210=That is correct. Very good.
M3000_S0040_G0030_300_a9s=Yeah, yeah. I won't do anything like thaaat.
M3000_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=Are you... treating me like a child?
M3000_S0040_G0040_300_op210=Be aware that the target looks identical to a standard unit. \nHowever, a marker will be displayed when you approach it.
M3000_S0040_G0050_001_op210=You're imagining things.
M3000_S0040_G0050_300_a9s=You know, I feel like those guys are getting smarter.
M3000_S0040_G0060_001_op210=The Machine Lifeforms receiving the anti-air system's signal,
M3000_S0040_G0060_300_op210=Ugh. You destroyed it again, didn't you...?
M3000_S0040_G0070_001_op210=should be in high places with good signal reception.
M3000_S0040_G0070_300_op210=You have to give it a good *squeeze* when you hack! A *squeeze*! \nA replacement unit should be deployed soon, so please get it right next time.
M3000_S0040_G0071_001_op210=I have transferred the rough predicted locations of the hacking targets to your map.
M3000_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0080_300_a9s=Roger that.
M3000_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Whoops...
M3000_S0040_G0090_300_op210=It seems you succeeded in hacking. \nYou're a good boy.
M3000_S0040_G0100_001_op210=9S. Your order is to hack, not destroy.
M3000_S0040_G0100_300_a9s=I knew it, you *are* treating me like a child...
M3000_S0040_G0110_001_op210=Because if you break it, it will just be replaced, rendering the effort meaningless.
M3000_S0040_G0110_300_op210=I'm counting on you for the next one.
M3000_S0040_G0120_001_op210=Sneak up quietly from behind the enemy's field of view...
M3000_S0040_G0120_300_a9s=...Okaaay.
M3000_S0040_G0130_001_op210=and give it a good *squeeze* when you hack.
M3000_S0040_G0130_300_op210=Decline in defense system operating rate confirmed.
M3000_S0040_G0140_001_a9s=I know...
M3000_S0040_G0140_300_a9s=Just a little more.
M3000_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=What does "*squeeze* when you hack" even mean...
M3000_S0040_G0150_300_op210=Enemy defense system completely silenced. \nSee? You can do it when you try.
M3000_S0040_G0151_001_pod153=Report: Direct hacking of the target Large-scale Machine Lifeform is impossible.
M3000_S0040_G0152_001_pod153=Special protection detected. \nAccess seems to be denied to all non-Machine Lifeform entities.
M3000_S0040_G0153_001_pod153=Proposal: First, take control of a small-type enemy, then use that unit to hack the large-type enemy.
M3000_S0040_G0154_001_a9s=So I just need to perform a multi-stage hack...
M3000_S0040_G0160_001_op210=Everything seems to be proceeding smoothly.
M3000_S0040_G0160_300_a9s=I *always* can...
M3000_S0040_G0170_001_op210=All other Scanner squad members have been mobilized for this operation as well.
M3000_S0040_G0170_300_op210=Since it is a wonderful result, I have prepared a reward.
M3000_S0040_G0180_001_op210=We must ensure we don't fall behind.
M3000_S0040_G0180_300_op210=I'll leave it in my room, so please come pick it up later.
M3000_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=Okaaay. I'll make sure not to fall behiiind.
M3000_S0040_G0190_300_a9s=...A reward?
M3000_S0040_G0200_001_op210=9S.
M3000_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=What?
M3000_S0040_G0220_001_op210=Please stay as far away from the combat area as possible.
M3000_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=But if I do that, I can't provide support.
M3000_S0040_G0240_001_op210=Scanner models like you are not suited for combat.
M3000_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Huh? Are you worried about me?
M3000_S0040_G0260_001_op210=No. You would merely be a liability on the battlefield.
M3000_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=That's just mean.
M3000_S0040_G0280_001_a11s=11S to 9S. Can you hear me?
M3000_S0040_G0290_001_a9s=Loud and clear~
M3000_S0040_G0300_001_a11s=My assigned tasks are all finished. How about on your end?
M3000_S0040_G0310_001_a9s=Same here... I think I've got one left.
M3000_S0040_G0320_001_a11s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0330_001_a11s=Also, make sure you sync your data when you get back to the Bunker.
M3000_S0040_G0340_001_a9s=Ah... I forgot.
M3000_S0040_G0350_001_a11s=Your combat data hasn't been submitted, so the entire Scanner model line can't be updated.
M3000_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Roger. I'll take care of it once this operation is over.
M3000_S0040_G0370_001_a11s=I'm counting on you~
M3000_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Phew... I think that's all of my assigned targets.
M3000_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=It's starting...
M3000_S0050_G0020_001_pod153=Proposal: Rendezvous with 2B before the combat situation deteriorates.
M3000_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=I know.
M3000_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=Okay, marking the rendezvous point with 2B on the map... and done.
M5920_S0020_G0310_001_pod153=Alert: Deviating from planned operational area.
M5920_S0020_G0320_001_pod153=Recommendation: Return to the operational area immediately.
