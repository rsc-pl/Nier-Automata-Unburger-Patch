M1060_S0077_G0000_001_a9s=Dammit! The main body has an electromagnetic barrier, too...!?
M1060_S0077_G0010_001_a4b=Heh, looks like you're having trouble.
M1060_S0077_G0020_001_a9s=...A YoRHa unit?
M1060_S0077_G0030_001_a4b=We're a Hunter unit, dispatched from Northern 12C Defense HQ.
M1060_S0077_G0040_001_a4b=I'm the Captain, 4B.
M1060_S0077_G0050_001_a4b=Leave this to us.
M1060_S0077_G0060_001_a9s=2B!
M1060_S0077_G0070_001_a9s=Let's leave this to the reinforcements.
M1060_S0077_G0080_001_a9s=I've got an idea...
M1060_S0077_G0090_001_a9s=I've marked the location! Let's regroup there.
