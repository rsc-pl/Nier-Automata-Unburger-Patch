M1060_S0005_G0000_001_pascal=9S-san. What's the matter? You said you wanted to speak in person.
M1060_S0005_G0010_001_a9s=It'll be faster to show you the actual records than to talk about it...
M1060_S0005_G0020_001_sele=Initiate data transfer.
M1060_S0005_G0030_001_sele=Do not transfer data.
M1060_S0005_G0040_001_pascal=...I see.
M1060_S0005_G0050_001_pascal=This android named "A2"... she is indeed in our past records as well.
M1060_S0005_G0060_001_pascal=We recognize her as a dangerous android, but...
M1060_S0005_G0070_001_pascal=She never comes directly to this village.
M1060_S0005_G0080_001_pascal=I'm sorry. That's about all the information I have.
M1060_S0005_G0090_001_a9s=I see... Thank you.
M1060_S0005_G0170_001_a2b=Let's head back to the Resistance Camp for now, but stay on alert.
M1060_S0005_G0180_001_a2b=We need to check our self-data and resupply.
