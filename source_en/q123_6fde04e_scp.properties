M5122_S0010_G0000_300_ane=Sorry, please focus on the mission for now.
M5122_S0010_G0010_300_ane=I'm sorry to trouble you when you came all this way...
M5123_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Still, the YoRHa squadron really is strong. You're on a different level from us in the Resistance.
M5123_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Well, we are YoRHa's latest models. Unlike an old type like A2—
M5123_S0010_G0020_001_ane=...What?
M5123_S0010_G0030_001_ane=A2... Attacker Number 2...?
M5123_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=Do you know of her?
M5123_S0010_G0050_001_ane=No...
M5123_S0010_G0060_001_ane=...
M5123_S0010_G0070_001_ane=Sorry, but could you do me one more favor?
M5123_S0010_G0080_001_ane=If you have information on that old type YoRHa, A2, I want you to tell me.
M5123_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=We also need information on A2, but... why?
M5123_S0010_G0100_001_ane=...There's something I want to confirm.
M5123_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=Information on A2... but where should we even look...
M5123_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=How about we investigate the energy reactions generated during combat?
M5123_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=When an android or Machine Lifeform is destroyed, its fusion reactor and other systems go down,
M5123_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=and we can detect the energy released at that time.
M5123_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=Currently, we should be the only ones on a combat mission in this area, so...
M5123_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=I think there's a high probability A2 is at any location where we find an energy reaction.
M5123_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=They're concentrated in the Factory Ruins... I'll mark them on the map.
M5123_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=This is...
M5123_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=The aftermath of one of A2's battles, maybe?
M5123_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=As for A2's signal itself... it doesn't seem to be here.
M5123_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Hm? What's this?
M5123_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=Pod, please analyze.
M5123_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Analysis Result: Deduced to be a data log concerning YoRHa Special Designated Unit, A2.
M5123_S0010_G0240_001_a2b=What are the contents?
M5123_S0010_G0250_001_pod042=The damaged portion is large; further analysis is impossible.
M5123_S0010_G0260_001_a2b=Why... would a Machine Lifeform have information on A2...?
M5123_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=There are other reactions. Let's go.
M5123_S0010_G0280_001_ane=This is... data about A2!?
M5123_S0010_G0290_001_a2b=The chips were damaged, so we can barely read the contents.
M5123_S0010_G0300_001_ane=No, even so, this is a major find.
M5123_S0010_G0310_001_ane=It's possible there are still more data chips left in that area.
M5123_S0010_G0320_001_ane=If you find them, bring them to me.
M5123_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=There are no other data chip reactions. This seems to be the last one.
M5123_S0010_G0340_001_a2b=Pod. Analyze the recovered data chips, then cross-reference them.
M5123_S0010_G0350_001_pod042=Analysis Complete: Data group contains information regarding A2.
M5123_S0010_G0360_001_pod042=Cross-referencing with other data chips.
M5123_S0010_G0370_001_pod042=Cross-reference Complete: Presumed to be a report on the 14th Machine War's Pearl Harbor Descent Operation.
M5123_S0010_G0380_001_a2b=The Pearl Harbor Descent Operation...?
M5123_S0010_G0390_001_a9s=That was an operation carried out by the generation before us... the old-type YoRHa units.
M5123_S0010_G0400_001_a9s=For now, we've achieved our objective. Let's return to the Resistance Camp.
M5123_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=We've brought the data concerning A2. Please take a look.
M5123_S0030_G0010_001_ane=This is...!
M5123_S0030_G0020_001_ane=It really is that Number 2...
M5123_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=You know her?
M5123_S0030_G0040_001_ane=She's an older model, but a YoRHa Number 2, the same type as you...
M5123_S0030_G0050_001_ane=We fought in the same operation in the past.
M5123_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=...The Pearl Harbor Descent Operation.
M5123_S0030_G0070_001_ane=Yeah.
M5123_S0030_G0080_001_ane=The operation itself was a success. However, the dispatched YoRHa squadron was annihilated.
M5123_S0030_G0090_001_ane=The one who commanded that squadron was Number 2... A2.
M5123_S0030_G0100_001_ane=Did you meet her? What is she doing now?
M5123_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=A2... A destruction order has been issued from the Bunker for A2-san.
M5123_S0030_G0120_001_ane=What!?
M5123_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=She deserted from the YoRHa squadron and annihilated the pursuit unit sent after her.
M5123_S0030_G0140_001_ane=No way... A2 did...?
M5123_S0030_G0150_001_ane=...Sorry.
M5123_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=...
M5123_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5123_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=I wonder what happened between Anemone-san and A2-san...
M5123_S0030_G0190_001_a2b=...Some things take time to be able to talk about.
M5123_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Especially for a soldier who has been fighting for a long time.
M5123_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=I suppose so...
M5123_S0030_G0220_001_a2b=9S, you too...
M5123_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=Huh?
M5123_S0030_G0240_001_a2b=...A day might come when you understand, too.
M5123_S0030_G0250_001_a9s=...Yes.
