M3030_S0025_G0000_001_a2=Alright... Now I just have to take this to Pascal's place.
M3030_S0025_G0010_001_pascal=...Can you hear me!? A2-san!
M3030_S0025_G0020_001_a2=Ah, perfect timing. The materials you asked for are...
M3030_S0025_G0030_001_pascal=A2-san! The village... It's terrible!
M3030_S0025_G0040_001_pascal=The villagers are... Aah!!
M3030_S0025_G0050_001_a2=Hey! Pascal!? What's wrong?
M3030_S0025_G0060_001_a2=What in the world... is happening...!?
M3030_S0025_G0070_001_pod042=Speculation: A problem has occurred with Pascal, a valuable information source.
M3030_S0025_G0080_001_pod042=Recommendation: Investigation of the state of Pascal's Village.
M3030_S0025_G0090_001_a2=You don't have to tell me...!
M3030_S0025_G0100_300_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt investigation of the state of Pascal's Village.
M3030_S0025_G0110_300_a2=I know.
