M1050_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=...That concludes the report on the alien ship.
M1050_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=I see... So the Aliens are already...
M1050_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=...Until the Council of Humanity reaches a conclusion,
M1050_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=this information is to be handled as top secret.
M1050_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=Be absolutely certain not to speak of this to anyone.
M1050_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Yes, ma'am.
M1050_S0010_G0060_001_cmd=You two are ordered to gather intelligence on the Machine Lifeform known as "Pascal."
M1050_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=What?! You mean that suspicious-looking Machine Lifeform?
M1050_S0010_G0080_001_cmd=This is a directive from the Council of Humanity on the moon.
M1050_S0010_G0090_001_cmd=The investigation of unique individuals will provide crucial data for future operations.
M1050_S0010_G0100_001_a2b=Understood.
M1050_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=The Commander really knows how to work people, doesn't she?
M1050_S0010_G0111_001_a9s=And on top of that, our destination is the City Ruins again.
M1050_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=It's been a while, why don't we take a little break, 2B?
M1050_S0010_G0113_001_a2b=If I feel like it.
M1050_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=But man, work is tough, isn't it?
M1050_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=Missions aren't about what you like or dislike.
M1050_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=9S, you display too much emotion.
M1050_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=We of YoRHa are prohibited from expressing emotions.
M1050_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=You say that, but there are individual differences. I don't think it can be helped...
M1050_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=Those unique individuals, Adam and Eve, they seemed like they had emotions, too.
M1050_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=...Enough. Let's go to the transfer device.
M1050_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Yes, ma'am.
