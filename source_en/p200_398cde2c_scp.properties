M1080_S0030_G0000_101_ane=I see... 9S had it rough, huh.
M1080_S0030_G0010_101_ane=As requested, I'll launch his body up to your Command.
M1080_S0030_G0020_101_a2b=Thank you...
M1080_S0030_G0030_101_ane=Huh!?
M1080_S0030_G0040_101_a2b=Is something wrong?
M1080_S0030_G0050_101_ane=I'm just surprised to hear words like that coming from you.
M1080_S0030_G0060_101_a2b=...
M1080_S0030_G0070_101_ane=Well, whatever.
M1080_S0030_G0080_101_ane=Oh, right, I have a message for you.
M1080_S0030_G0090_101_ane=Your Command wants you to get in touch.
M1080_S0030_G0100_101_a2b=Understood.
M1080_S0030_G0110_101_a2b=This is 2B. Connect me to the Commander.
M1080_S0030_G0120_101_op60=Ah, 2B-san. Roger that.
M1080_S0030_G0130_101_op60=Please wait just a moment...
M1080_S0030_G0140_101_cmd=2B.
M1080_S0030_G0150_101_cmd=Good work destroying the enemy Machine Lifeform... Codename "Adam".
M1080_S0030_G0160_101_cmd=Our analysis has revealed that Adam was managing half of their entire network system.
M1080_S0030_G0170_101_cmd=With their network destroyed, the Machine Lifeforms should be significantly weakened.
M1080_S0030_G0180_101_a2b=Commander. How is 9S?
M1080_S0030_G0190_101_cmd=We will be performing a full data overhaul on 9S here.
M1080_S0030_G0200_101_cmd=If there are no problems, I plan to have him accompany you again.
M1080_S0030_G0210_101_a2b=Please take care of him.
M1080_S0030_G0220_101_cmd=While 9S is out of commission, I'd like to entrust you with another mission.
M1080_S0030_G0230_101_cmd=I've mailed you the details. Please confirm them.
M1080_S0030_G0240_101_a2b=Roger.
M1080_S0030_G0250_101_a2b=Monitor trends among the Machine Lifeforms, huh...
M1080_S0030_G0260_101_a2b=That being said, if I run into any, I'll probably kill them on sight...
M1080_S0030_G0270_101_pod042=Proposal: Obtain information from a fellow machine, the Machine Lifeform "Pascal".
M1080_S0030_G0280_101_a2b=I see. Pascal might know something.
M1080_S0030_G0290_101_a2b=Hello... Can you hear me, Pascal?
M1080_S0030_G0300_101_pascal=Ah... 2B-san. What is it?
M1080_S0030_G0310_101_a2b=If you've noticed anything about the recent activities of Machine Lifeforms, please tell me.
M1080_S0030_G0320_101_pascal=Recent activities among Machine Lifeforms?
M1080_S0030_G0330_101_pascal=Come to think of it, two days ago, we received a message regarding a peace treaty
M1080_S0030_G0340_101_pascal=from a group of Machine Lifeforms that had disconnected from the central network.
M1080_S0030_G0350_101_a2b=A peace treaty?
M1080_S0030_G0360_101_pascal=Yes. Those who escaped the network's control wish to form an alliance with our village.
M1080_S0030_G0370_101_a2b=Then couldn't they just join your village...?
M1080_S0030_G0380_101_pascal=No, it seems they have already built a large colony.
M1080_S0030_G0390_101_a2b=A colony?
M1080_S0030_G0400_101_pascal=Yes. It appears they have taken refuge in the Abandoned Factory.
M1080_S0030_G0410_101_pascal=If you are interested, I will transfer the location data to you.
M1080_S0030_G0420_101_a2b=Please do.
M1080_S0030_G0430_101_pascal=I was thinking I needed to go speak with them soon anyway.
M1080_S0030_G0440_101_pascal=Let's meet up there.
M1080_S0030_G0450_101_a2b=Roger.
M1080_S0030_G0460_101_pascal=2B-san. Hello.
M1080_S0030_G0470_101_pascal=Well then, shall we?
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Notification of mail received from Access Point.
M5920_S0010_G0281_001_pod042=Obtained information on target location. Marking on map.
