M1060_S0070_G0000_001_a2b=This is... a machine lifeform!?
M1060_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=It's huge... I've never seen anything like it...
M1060_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=Damn... It's using EMP attacks to keep us from getting close...
M1060_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=We have to find another way to attack it...
M1060_S0070_G0040_011_op60=2B-san! We've received approval for a direct satellite laser strike!
M1060_S0070_G0050_011_op60=But the targeting is unstable because of the electromagnetic camouflage the enemy is generating.
M1060_S0070_G0060_011_op60=Please pinpoint the source and destroy it!
M1060_S0070_G0070_011_a2b=You make it sound easy...
M1060_S0070_G0080_011_op60=I'm sorry! But please, do your best!
M1060_S0070_G0131_011_pod042=Confirmed position of EMP generator. Marking on map.
M1060_S0070_G0132_011_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0140_011_pod042=Notification: Enemy intel acquired from Command.
M1060_S0070_G0150_011_a2b=Open the intel.
M1060_S0070_G0160_011_pod042=The giant machine lifeform has only one other record, confirmed 320 years ago.
M1060_S0070_G0170_011_pod042=After making landfall, it executed an ultra-high-intensity electromagnetic wave attack.
M1060_S0070_G0180_011_pod042=During the battle at that time, the Resistance escort unit was annihilated.
M1060_S0070_G0190_011_a2b=In other words, if we don't stop it from landing, that tragedy will happen again...
M1060_S0070_G0200_011_pod042=Affirmative. That deduction is supported.
M1060_S0070_G0210_011_op60=Confirmed disappearance of jamming electromagnetic waves!
M1060_S0070_G0220_011_op60=Satellite laser attack is inbound!
