M5162_S0000_G0000_300_op60=Regarding the interruption of the Access Point signal, I'm counting on you.
M5162_S0010_G0000_001_op60=This is Operator 6O. Can you hear me, 2B-san?

M5162_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=Roger.
M5162_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=There are Machine Lifeforms here...
M5162_S0010_G0060_001_pod042=Confirmed jamming radio waves originating from some enemy individuals.
M5162_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=Jamming?
M5162_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=...This is a problem.

M5162_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=What is it?
M5162_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=The cause of the Access Point malfunction was a Machine Lifeform emitting jamming radio waves.
M5162_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=...You mean they understand that those facilities are our communication terminals?
M5162_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=That's not all. Even though they understood it was a communication terminal, they didn't destroy the Access Point.
M5162_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=They were probably... setting a trap.
M5162_S0010_G0180_001_cmd=Has their intelligence developed that far... Those machines.
