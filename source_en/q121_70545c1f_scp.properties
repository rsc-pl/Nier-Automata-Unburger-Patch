M5121_S0010_G0000_001_ane=......
M5121_S0010_G0000_300_manager=Did you find the "Box that Makes Sound when Opened"?
M5121_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=You look like you have a difficult expression on your face, Anemone-san.
M5121_S0010_G0010_300_manager=I'm sorry, could you come back later?
M5121_S0010_G0020_001_ane=Ah, recently, work at the material storage has been stagnating.
M5121_S0010_G0020_300_manager=Everyone is fighting desperately, I can't be complaining... \nI have to do my best...
M5121_S0010_G0030_001_ane=The manager in charge is usually a capable guy, but...
M5121_S0010_G0040_001_ane=It seems he has some worries, and he can't put his heart into the work.
M5121_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I don't know what he's worried about, but we must do something before it affects the whole operation...
M5121_S0010_G0051_001_ane=The manager should be up the scaffolding assembled in the back of the camp.
M5121_S0010_G0052_001_ane=If you don't mind, please listen to what he has to say.
M5121_S0010_G0060_001_manager=Sigh... It bothers me... It bothers me too much...
M5121_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Ummm, what is bothering you?
M5121_S0010_G0080_001_manager=Hm... Who are you?
M5121_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=We are people from the YoRHa squadron.
M5121_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=We were told by Anemone-san to check on the condition of this camp.
M5121_S0010_G0110_001_manager=I see...
M5121_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=So, what on earth is bothering you?
M5121_S0010_G0130_001_manager=Ah, actually, I can't stop thinking and thinking about the "Box that Makes Sound when Opened" that my colleague had.
M5121_S0010_G0140_001_manager=When you open the box, a very beautiful tone flows out.
M5121_S0010_G0150_001_manager=But, no matter what, the melody becomes ambiguous halfway through...
M5121_S0010_G0160_001_manager=Ah, it bothers me!
M5121_S0010_G0170_001_manager=In the first place, it would be fine if that guy would just come back quickly! Ah, jeez!
M5121_S0010_G0180_001_sele=Search for the "Box that Makes Sound when Opened".
M5121_S0010_G0190_001_sele=Leave him alone since he's neurotic.
M5121_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=At this rate, it doesn't look like he'll get any work done...
M5121_S0010_G0210_001_a2b=A "Box that Makes Sound when Opened", huh...
M5121_S0010_G0220_001_pod042=Deduction: Name is "Music Box" (Orgel). Possibility of existing in a location where music plays.
M5121_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=In the vicinity, the Amusement Park is cited as a candidate.
M5121_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=That's a very simplistic idea...
M5121_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=But we have no other leads, so shall we go?
M5121_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=I wonder if this is the music box that material storage manager was talking about?
M5121_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=It's quite rusted, though.
M5121_S0010_G0280_001_a2b=A corpse...
M5121_S0010_G0290_001_a9s=Was the owner... this android?
M5121_S0010_G0300_001_a9s=Judging by the condition, it seems they passed away a long time ago.
M5121_S0010_G0310_001_a2b=...Anyway, let's deliver this box to the manager.
M5121_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Excuse me, is this the "Box that Makes Sound when Opened" you were looking for?
M5121_S0030_G0010_001_manager=Yes! This is it, this is it! Where was it?
M5121_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=In the Amusement Park... near the remains of the android thought to be the owner.
M5121_S0030_G0030_001_manager=Ah...
M5121_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=That person was...
M5121_S0030_G0050_001_manager=...
M5121_S0030_G0060_001_manager=...It's rusted quite a bit, but if I repair it, surely it will ring again.
M5121_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Yes, of course.
M5121_S0030_G0080_001_manager=...Thank you for bringing the box.
M5121_S0030_G0090_001_manager=Now I can put my heart into my work!
M5121_S0030_G0100_001_manager=You folks are free to come and go in the back area now, too.
