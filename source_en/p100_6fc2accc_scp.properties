M1020_S0950_G0010_001_a2b=What on earth... was that Machine Lifeform...
M1020_S0950_G0020_001_a9s=It was a type we haven't seen before.
M1020_S0950_G0030_001_a9s=Let's report to Command later.
M1020_S0950_G0031_001_pod042=Movement through areas with high flow volume is difficult.
M1020_S0950_G0032_001_pod042=Recommendation: Move through the rocky area.
M1020_S0950_G0130_300_a9s=It stopped... It seems we're safe if we've come this far.
M1030_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Let's move to an area with good communication status to contact Command.
M1030_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Communication with Command is now possible.
M1030_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=From 9S to Bunker. Please respond.
M1030_S0010_G0030_001_op210=From Operator to 9S. Message received.
M1030_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Just now, we encountered a Machine Lifeform that was human-form...\nin other words, possessing a texture similar to an Android.
M1030_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Unfortunately, we let it get away but...
M1030_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=I will transmit the combat data from that time.
M1030_S0010_G0070_001_op210=Roger that. Initiating transfer.
M1030_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Well then, I leave the analysis to you.
M1030_S0010_G0081_001_a9s=...Phew, that settles things for now.
M1030_S0010_G0082_001_a9s=2B, I want to consult you regarding our operational behavior from here on.
M1030_S0010_G0083_001_a9s=I'm worried about the damage received in the battle with that Machine Lifeform earlier.
M1030_S0010_G0084_001_a9s=Shall we return to the Resistance Camp once to resupply and perform maintenance?
M1030_S0010_G0085_001_sele=Return to the Resistance Camp.
M1030_S0010_G0086_001_sele=Continue fighting as is.
M1030_S0010_G0087_001_a2b=True... Let's return to the Resistance Camp for now.
M1030_S0010_G0088_001_a9s=Roger that.
M1030_S0010_G0089_001_a2b=No, let's continue and eliminate the Machine Lifeforms as is.
M1030_S0010_G0090_001_op210=From Operator to 9S. Transfer of previous data is complete.
M1030_S0010_G0091_001_a9s=Roger that. Please don't push yourself too hard, 2B.
M1030_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Roger that.
M1030_S0010_G0110_001_op210=On a separate matter, there is a message from the Commander to both 2B and 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Playing now.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=Several YoRHa units heading to the surface have lost contact.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=Since their Black Box signals are currently still confirmed,\nit is presumed they are not dead.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We have narrowed down the point where the signals are being emitted,
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=so I order YoRHa unit members currently on the surface to investigate this matter.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=That is all. Ending communication.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Come to think of it... I heard a similar story at the Resistance Camp...
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=I've set the target point information.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=I feel like we should go as soon as possible.
M1030_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, 2B.
M1030_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=The Machine Lifeform in the desert, its appearance was completely identical to an android, wasn't it.
M1030_S0050_G0020_001_a2b=Certainly.
M1030_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=We androids are made mimicking the form of our creators, humans, but...
M1030_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=Why would Machine Lifeforms imitate our form?
M1030_S0050_G0050_001_a2b=............
M1030_S0050_G0060_001_a2b=...It is a waste to spend time on things we cannot understand by thinking.
M1030_S0050_G0070_001_a9s=...You're right.
M1030_S0050_G0071_001_a9s=It seems the route from the surface is blocked...
M1030_S0050_G0072_001_a9s=Let's see if we can go from underground.
M5920_S0010_G0100_001_pod042=Alert.
M5920_S0020_G0100_001_pod153=Alert.
