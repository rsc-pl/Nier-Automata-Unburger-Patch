M6010_S0090_G0060_300_op=So, you finally defeated Eve.
M6010_S0090_G0070_300_op=Thank you, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0080_300_op=You did well, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0090_300_op=No really~ thank you so much~
M6010_S0090_G0480_300_op=Ah! 2B-san! Did you take Eve's data!?\nPlease share it quickly!
M6010_S0090_G0490_300_ys=Hey hey, save it for later.
M6010_S0090_G0500_300_op=Good work.\nAre you not tired? Why not take some recovery medicine?
M6010_S0090_G0510_300_op=If you perform as well as you do, I think it should all be free, though.
M6010_S0090_G0630_300_ysA=Ugh, bleeegh......
M6010_S0090_G0640_300_ysB=Relax, thanks to 2B and the others, the number of sorties will probably decrease somewhat.
M6010_S0090_G0650_300_ysA=R-Really!? Thank you so mu—bleeegh!
M6010_S0090_G0660_300_ysA=Thank you so mu—bleeegh!
M6010_S0090_G0670_300_ysA=I thought of a good thing.\nHow about trying to transplant Eve's self-regeneration function into the flight units?
M6010_S0090_G0680_300_ysB=Wow! That might be good!\nZero repair costs!
M6010_S0090_G0690_300_op=Obviously that's no good!\nEveryone would get contaminated by the virus and their bodies would be ruined!
M6010_S0090_G0700_300_ysA=Ahaha, it's a joke, a joke.
M6010_S0090_G0710_300_ysA=......I thought it was a good plan though.
M6010_S0100_G0060_300_op=I'll support you with all my power.\nI pray for your success.
M6010_S0100_G0070_300_op=If it's us, we can do it.
M6010_S0100_G0080_300_op=Let's end it, this war of ours.
M6010_S0100_G0090_300_op=I fully tuned the information processing system, so leave the support to me~!
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=I pray for your success.
M6010_S0100_G0450_300_ys=Roger.
M6010_S0100_G0460_300_op=Why don't you organize your equipment before sorting?
M6010_S0100_G0570_300_ysA=Ugh, bleeegh...... I have to go... ugh bleeegh......
M6010_S0100_G0580_300_ysB=Yeah, let's go. Don't vomit in space.
M6010_S0100_G0590_300_ysA=Shall we go too.
M6010_S0100_G0600_300_ysB=Yes.
M6010_S0100_G0610_300_op=Good fortune in battle.
