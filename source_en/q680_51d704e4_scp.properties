M5680_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Hello! You're androids, aren't you?
M5680_S0010_G0010_001_n02=The world is overflowing with love, wouldn't you agree?
M5680_S0010_G0020_001_sele=That might be true...
M5680_S0010_G0030_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0040_001_n02=Don't you think we should express our joy more freely?
M5680_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Maybe we should...
M5680_S0010_G0060_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0070_001_n02=Exactly! In that case...
M5680_S0010_G0080_001_n02=To make this world an even better place, would you be willing to help us a little?
M5680_S0010_G0090_001_sele=I'll help...
M5680_S0010_G0100_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0110_001_n02=...Really?
M5680_S0010_G0120_001_n02=Do you really believe in something so fanciful... that the world can be connected by love?
M5680_S0010_G0130_001_sele=I believe.
M5680_S0010_G0140_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Is that so...
M5680_S0010_G0170_001_n02=I see... I feel like you, of all people, could believe it.
M5680_S0010_G0180_001_n02=The truth is, even among us Machine Lifeforms, there are many who despise fighting.
M5680_S0010_G0190_001_n02=So I decided to gather my comrades and hold a parade.
M5680_S0010_G0200_001_n02=A Parade of Love, to share our friendship with the world.
M5680_S0010_G0210_001_n02=However, there are also many who hate peaceful activities like ours.
M5680_S0010_G0220_001_n02=Please... won't you protect us so that our parade can be a success?
M5680_S0010_G0230_001_sele=I will protect you.
M5680_S0010_G0240_001_sele=I will not protect you.
M5680_S0010_G0250_001_n02=That's a shame. If you change your mind, please let me know.
M5680_S0010_G0260_001_n02=As a gesture of friendship, we want to march to the Resistance Camp. Won't you help us?
M5680_S0010_G0270_001_n02=Thank you for your cooperation!
M5680_S0010_G0280_001_n02=Then, we would be overjoyed if you could escort our friends during the parade!
M5680_S0010_G0290_001_n02=And now... LET'S FRIENDSHIP!!
M5680_S0020_G0000_001_robos=LET'S SHARE OUR JOY!!
M5680_S0020_G0010_001_robos=LET'S STOP FIGHTING!!
M5680_S0020_G0020_001_robos=LET'S SPREAD LOVE!!
M5680_S0020_G0030_001_robos=LET'S LIVE JOYFULLY!!
M5680_S0020_G0040_001_robos=LET'S CAST AWAY HATRED!!
M5680_S0020_G0050_001_n02=Hiii! Help us, please! Help!
M5680_S0020_G0060_001_n02=We didn't come here to fight!
M5680_S0020_G0070_001_n02=Help us!!
M5680_S0020_G0080_001_n02=We need LOVE!!
M5680_S0020_G0090_001_n02=Noooooooo!
M5680_S0020_G0100_001_n02=Heeeeeelp!!
M5680_S0020_G0110_001_n02=We don't want to fight!
M5680_S0020_G0120_001_n02=JOY!
M5680_S0020_G0130_001_n02=Thank you so much.
M5680_S0020_G0140_001_n02=Thanks to you, our parade wasn't completely wiped out.
M5680_S0020_G0150_001_n02=Here... it's not much, but it's a token of my thanks. Please, take it.
M5680_S0020_G0160_001_n02=Ugh... Why must there be such violence...
M5680_S0020_G0170_001_n02=But... I won't give up. I'm going to do it again...!
M5680_S0020_G0180_001_n02=This time for sure... I want to create a parade that brings peace to the world.
M5680_S0020_G0190_001_sele=I will cooperate.
M5680_S0020_G0200_001_sele=I will not cooperate.
M5680_S0040_G0030_001_n02=Don't say that. Come on, let's go!
M5680_S0040_G0060_001_n02=We succeeded in spreading Joy this time as well!
M5680_S0040_G0070_001_n02=We're planning to hold another parade in a different location next time. I'll be counting on you then!
M5680_S0040_G0080_001_n02=Um...
M5680_S0040_G0090_001_n02=Do you think we're fools?
M5680_S0040_G0100_001_n02=...
M5680_S0040_G0110_001_n02=...My apologies. We'd be grateful for your help again.
M5680_S0050_G0000_001_n02=...Ah, it's you.
M5680_S0050_G0010_001_n02=I couldn't keep up with them anymore.
M5680_S0050_G0020_001_n02=What joy? What love? No matter how many lives you have, it wouldn't be enough for that.
M5680_S0050_G0030_001_n02=Hm? You're asking where the parade group went?
M5680_S0050_G0040_001_n02=Them? They set off on a journey, saying they would bring "Joy to the ends of the world"...
M5680_S0050_G0050_001_n02=We lost contact with them at the edge of the desert.
M5680_S0050_G0060_001_n02=A bunch of idiots... I'm sure they've died in a ditch somewhere.
M5680_S0050_G0070_001_n02=Love, joy... So ridiculous.
