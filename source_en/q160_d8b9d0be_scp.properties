M5160_S0000_G0000_300_cmd=Deliver the necessary materials to the Resistance Leader.
M5160_S0010_G0000_001_cmd=Ah, come to think of it, there is a job I wish to request.
M5160_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=I want you to improve the communication environment between the surface and here.
M5160_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=This is to allow for more efficient operational deployment.
M5160_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=First, I need you to deliver the necessary materials to the leader of the Resistance Camp.
M5160_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=The method for obtaining these materials will be conveyed via your Operator after you descend to the surface.
M5160_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Roger.
M5160_S0020_G0000_001_op60=From Operator to 2B-san.
M5160_S0020_G0010_001_op60=Please collect the necessary materials for improving the communication environment.
M5160_S0020_G0020_001_op60=The required materials are "Rusty Bolts," "Small Gears," and "Springs."
M5160_S0020_G0021_001_op60=It seems these can sometimes be obtained from smaller enemies.
M5160_S0020_G0030_001_op60=Once you've gathered the materials, please hand them to the Resistance Camp leader, Anemone-san.
M5160_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=Roger.
M5160_S0020_G0050_001_op60=It's a little tough, but please do your best, 2B-san!
M5160_S0020_G0060_001_op210=From Operator to 9S.
M5160_S0020_G0070_001_op60=I will now convey the necessary materials for improving the communication environment.
M5160_S0020_G0080_001_op60=The required materials are "Rusty Bolts," "Small Gears," and "Springs."
M5160_S0020_G0081_001_op60=It seems these materials can sometimes be obtained from smaller enemies.
M5160_S0020_G0090_001_op60=Once the materials are gathered, hand them over to Resistance Camp Leader Anemone.
M5160_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Roger thaaat~
M5160_S0020_G0110_001_op210=There's no need to drag out the end of your words. Over.
M5160_S0030_G0000_001_op60=From Operator 6O to 2B-san.
M5160_S0030_G0010_001_op60=It seems you've obtained all the materials needed to improve the communication environment.
M5160_S0030_G0020_001_op60=Please hand the collected materials to Anemone-san. That will conclude the mission.
M5160_S0030_G0030_001_op210=From Operator 21O to 9S.
M5160_S0030_G0040_001_op60=I have confirmed that the materials necessary for improving the communication environment are assembled.
M5160_S0030_G0050_001_op60=Please hand the collected materials to the Resistance Leader. Over.
M5160_S0040_G0000_001_ane=I've received word from the Bunker.
M5160_S0040_G0010_001_ane=The materials for the communication environment maintenance, correct? I have received them.
M5160_S0040_G0020_001_ane=This isn't much, but take it as a reward. It's probably a violation of regulations, so I'll keep it a secret from the Commander.
M5160_S0040_G0030_001_a2b=2B to Operator 6O. Material handover is complete.
M5160_S0040_G0040_001_op60=Roger. Good work!
M5160_S0040_G0050_001_a9s=...Good grief, the Commander works people as hard as ever, doesn't she?
M5160_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=She's strict about the rules, too. She must live a life like an efficiency-obsessed robot.
M5160_S0040_G0070_001_op60=The Commander isn't that stiff, you know?
M5160_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Huh? What do you mean?
M5160_S0040_G0090_001_op60=The Commander, despite how she looks, is surprisingly sloppy.
M5160_S0040_G0100_001_op60=When she takes off her clothes, she just leaves them lying around and lets them pile up. The laundry team is always complaining about it.
M5160_S0040_G0110_001_op60=Plus, she completely ignores things like maintenance checks on her own body.
M5160_S0040_G0120_001_op60=Though I suppose not showing those messy parts of herself to people is very much like her.
M5160_S0040_G0130_001_a2b=How do you know that?
M5160_S0040_G0140_001_op60=Fufufu... It's a secret.
M5160_S0040_G0150_001_op60=Well then.
M5160_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=A secret...
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location information obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location information obtained. Marking on map.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How are you holding up? Don't be too reckless.
