M1010_S0050_G0040_300_a9s=The plant life has really taken over this place, but it must have been a pretty big city back in the day.
M1010_S0060_G0000_001_a9s=So this is the Resistance Camp...
M1010_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=First, let's go ask the leader for information.
M1010_S0060_G0020_001_ane=You're...
M1010_S0060_G0025_001_ane=Number Two...
M1010_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=Huh? Do you know 2B?
M1010_S0060_G0040_001_ane=...No. We received a transmission from the Bunker.
M1010_S0060_G0050_001_ane=My name is Anemone.
M1010_S0060_G0060_001_ane=I'm in charge of the Android Resistance throughout this area.
M1010_S0060_G0070_001_ane=I heard the story from the Bunker. Seems you've been put in charge of investigating this area.
M1010_S0060_G0080_001_ane=The others would know more about intel than I do.
M1010_S0060_G0090_001_ane=You don't need to go through me, so feel free to ask around.
M1010_S0060_G0100_001_ane=You'll probably be using the Weapons and Item Shops frequently, so it might be a good idea to say hello.
M1010_S0060_G0110_001_ane=Also, there's a strange one near the entrance wearing a Machine Lifeform's head...
M1010_S0060_G0120_001_ane=She's weird, but she knows a lot, so you might want to ask her a few things.
M1020_S0005_G0000_001_ane=That's right. I have a request for you as well.
M1020_S0005_G0010_001_ane=Lately, it seems a number of vicious Machine Lifeforms have been appearing in the Desert Zone.
M1020_S0005_G0020_001_ane=This has never happened before, so something might be going on.
M1020_S0005_G0030_001_ane=I hear you YoRHa troops are also skilled at investigations.
M1020_S0005_G0040_001_ane=Would you be willing to investigate the cause of the disturbance in the Desert Zone?
M1020_S0005_G0050_001_ane=Help.
M1020_S0005_G0060_001_ane=Don't help.
M1020_S0005_G0070_001_ane=Is that so? Thank you.
M1020_S0005_G0080_001_ane=I'll contact our comrades in the desert and let them know you're coming.
M1020_S0005_G0090_001_ane=Please, be careful.
M1020_S0005_G0100_001_ane=I see... If you change your mind, come talk to me again.
M5920_S0100_G0000_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B-san. Time for your regular check-in.
M5920_S0100_G0010_001_a2b=This is 2B. All clear.
M5920_S0100_G0020_001_op60=That's good to hear. Is the weather on Earth nice today?
M5920_S0100_G0030_001_a2b=No issues... Is that information relevant to the mission?
M5920_S0100_G0040_001_op60=Oh, no, not at all. I was just thinking, if the weather is nice, maybe you'd feel good, you know?
M5920_S0100_G0050_001_a2b=Whether I feel good or not is irrelevant to the mission.
M5920_S0100_G0060_001_op60=Haha... That's so like you, 2B-san.
M5920_S0100_G0070_001_op60=Well then, talk to you later!
M5920_S0100_G0320_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. Commencing regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0330_001_a9s=Yessir. This is 9S. No abnormalities he~re. And wow, the weather today is great...
M5920_S0100_G0340_001_op210=No abnormalities reported. Understood.
M5920_S0100_G0350_001_op210=Weather information is not required. Over and out.
M5920_S0100_G0360_001_a9s=Man, my operator's as stiff as ever...
M5920_S0100_G0370_001_a9s=Then again, I guess that's one of her good points.
M6090_S0010_G0015_300_kj=Ah, new face? \nYou should go talk to the Captain over there.
M6090_S0010_G0045_300_toolshop=From YoRHa? First, please talk to the leader.\nWe have all sorts of... customs here.
M6090_S0010_G0125_300_resiman=The one running this place is the Leader, Anemone-neesan.\nYou should go greet her first.
M6090_S0010_G0145_300_resiman=...Don't recognize you.
M6090_S0010_G0165_300_resiman=Whoops. Did you go to see the Leader?
M6090_S0010_G0195_300_resiman=............
M6090_S0010_G0255_300_resiwoman=Anemone-san over there is the leader of this camp.
M6090_S0010_G0285_300_resiwoman=Ah, hello! You're from the YoRHa forces, right? We've been expecting you! Have you met the leader, Anemone-san? You haven't? Or have you?
M6090_S0010_G0415_300_resiwoman=Hey. If you're going to investigate the camp, could you go through the proper channels first?
M6090_S0010_G0435_300_resiwoman=...Umm... who... are you?
M6090_S0010_G0455_300_resiwoman=The leader is in the back of the tent.
M6090_S0010_G0485_300_resiman=Are you a new face too?
M6090_S0010_G0515_300_resiman=Don't you end up getting carried into this infirmary, you hear...?
M6090_S0010_G0535_300_resiman=Hey, hey. Little misses. First you talk to the leader, Anemone-san.\nThat's how we do things here.
M6090_S0010_G0555_300_resiwoman=New here? A pleasure to meet you.
M6090_S0010_G0575_300_resiman=...
M6090_S0010_G0605_300_resiwoman=I think the leader, Anemone-san, is in the tent in the main square.
M6090_S0010_G0625_300_resiwoman=There are certain things we can't discuss with outsiders...
M6090_S0010_G0645_300_resiman=Hmm? A new YoRHa member...
M6090_S0010_G0665_300_resiman=Hey? You can't come this deep inside without the leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0685_300_resiman=Sorry. We have a rule that you have to talk to the leader first.
M6090_S0010_G0705_300_resiman=The rules here are especially strict compared to other camps.\nPlease start by getting the leader's approval.
M6090_S0010_G0735_300_resiman=Ah, the leader isn't here, you know.
M6090_S0010_G0785_300_resiman=Hm? You're not allowed to be wandering around here without the leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0805_300_ys=Ah, a new face. You should go talk to the leader, Anemone, first.
M6090_S0010_G0835_300_bs=Ah, from the YoRHa forces?\nCould you please meet with the leader, Anemone-san, first?
M6090_S0091_G0001_300_hennawresi=You two, are you new faces from the YoRHa troops?\nIf so, you should go meet the leader here.
