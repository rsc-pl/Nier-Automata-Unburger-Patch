M6110_S0230_G0010_001_n02=There was a guy selling materials in the lobby right?\nThat guy was quite skilled.

M6110_S0230_G0030_001_n02=Maybe because he started applying the proceeds to his ego backup data area too,\nhe started becoming a little weird......
M6110_S0230_G0040_001_n02=You might not have known, but that guy was among those you defeated.
