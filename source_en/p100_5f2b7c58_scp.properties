M0010_S0700_G0031_101_a2b=That's...
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=Oh, are those birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Maybe because of the environmental changes, but it seems there are\nmore animals and plants now than in the Old World.
M0010_S0700_G0040_101_a2b=I've swept the factory, but found no sign of the target weapon.
M0010_S0700_G0060_101_a9s=Maybe they moved it to another location.
M0010_S0700_G0061_101_a9s=There should be another facility beyond that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G0062_101_a9s=It's a little far, but shall we head over?
M0010_S0700_G0070_101_a9s=Still, for Command to mistake the predicted location of an enemy weapon... that's rare.
M0010_S0700_G0080_101_a2b=No.
M0010_S0700_G0090_101_a2b=I'm not so sure...
