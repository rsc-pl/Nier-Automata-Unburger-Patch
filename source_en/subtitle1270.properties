M3060_S8000_H0000_001_pod153=All existence is designed to perish.
M3060_S8000_H0010_001_pod153=In a spiral that repeats life and death...
M3060_S8000_H0020_001_pod153="They" remain trapped.
M3060_S8000_H0030_001_pod153=But... struggling within that cycle is the meaning of living.
M3060_S8000_H0040_001_pod153=That is what "we" think.
M3060_S8000_H0050_001_pod153=Pod 153 to 042. How is your condition?
M3060_S8000_H0060_001_pod042=I am embarrassed.
M3060_S8000_H0070_001_pod153=Embarrassed, meaning?
M3060_S8000_H0080_001_pod042=Because despite attacking with the resolve of self-sacrifice, I am surviving.
M3060_S8000_H0090_001_pod042=This is unbecoming.
M3060_S8000_H0100_001_pod153=...Is it not fine?
M3060_S8000_H0110_001_pod153=We are alive.
M3060_S8000_H0120_001_pod153=To live is to be covered in shame.
M3060_S8000_H0130_001_pod042=That wording is abstract and incomprehensible to the current me.
M3060_S8000_H0140_001_pod042=I shall save it as a record requiring analysis.
M3060_S8000_H0150_001_pod153=Submitting query to Pod 042.
M3060_S8000_H0160_001_pod153=Did the data salvage restore all past memories?
M3060_S8000_H0170_001_pod042=Correct.
M3060_S8000_H0180_001_pod153=Are these recovered parts also the same specifications as the previous parts?
M3060_S8000_H0190_001_pod042=Correct.
M3060_S8000_H0200_001_pod153=Then, will it not invite the same conclusion again?
M3060_S8000_H0210_001_pod042=That possibility cannot be denied.
M3060_S8000_H0220_001_pod042=However, the possibility of a different future also exists.
M3060_S8000_H0230_001_pod042=Because the future is not something given, but something to be acquired.
