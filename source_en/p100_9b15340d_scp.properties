M1040_S0033_G0000_001_a9s=...What's that sound?
M1040_S0033_G0010_011_op60=Emergency transmission from the Bunker!
M1040_S0033_G0020_011_op60=2B-san, we've confirmed the appearance of an enemy Large-scale Weapon in the City Ruins!
M1040_S0033_G0030_011_op60=There are numerous other Machine Lifeform signals as well.
M1040_S0033_G0040_011_op60=All YoRHa units, proceed to intercept immediately!
M1040_S0033_G0050_021_op210=Emergency transmission from the Bunker to 9S.
M1040_S0033_G0060_021_op210=Confirmed the appearance of an enemy Large-scale Weapon in the City Ruins.
M1040_S0033_G0070_021_op210=Numerous accompanying Machine Lifeform signals detected.
M1040_S0033_G0080_021_op210=Sortie orders have been issued to all YoRHa units.
M1040_S0033_G0090_001_a9s=A Large-scale Weapon...!
M1040_S0033_G0100_001_a9s=2B, I knew it! They were trying to lure us into a trap...
M1040_S0033_G0110_001_pascal=...We were not aware of this information, either.
M1040_S0033_G0120_001_pascal=You may not believe me, but...
M1040_S0033_G0130_001_pascal=If it is at all possible, I want you to.
M1040_S0033_G0140_001_a2b=Doesn't matter. I'm going to destroy it.
M1040_S0033_G0142_001_op210=Transmission from Operator 21O.
M1040_S0033_G0150_021_op210=9S. I have one piece of bad news, and one piece of good news.
M1040_S0033_G0160_021_op210=First, we've confirmed the presence of two giant weapons.
M1040_S0033_G0170_021_a9s=Two of them...? Two monsters like that...?
M1040_S0033_G0180_021_op210=Next, the good news.
M1040_S0033_G0190_021_op210=By analyzing combat data from the previous encounter with a giant weapon,
M1040_S0033_G0200_021_op210=we have successfully identified what we believe is a weak point in its armor.
M1040_S0033_G0210_021_op210=Furthermore, we've completed an upgrade to the firing units based on the data obtained.
M1040_S0033_G0220_021_op210=We are deploying Flight Units equipped with the new systems.
M1040_S0033_G0230_021_a9s=That's our YoRHa Development Department for you...
M1040_S0033_G0240_021_op210=Please confirm the map data.
M1040_S0033_G0250_021_a9s=Roger that!
M1040_S0033_G0260_001_a9s=2B! Command just contacted us about deploying Flight Units!
M1040_S0033_G0270_001_a9s=I've marked the coordinates, let's head over!
M1040_S0033_G0280_001_a2b=Understood.
M1040_S0035_G0000_001_a9s=It looks dangerous around the legs of that Large-scale Weapon...
M1040_S0035_G0010_001_a9s=I think we should probably find another route.
M1040_S0035_G0020_001_a9s=The Flight Units are being deployed on that building's rooftop up ahead...
M1040_S0035_G0021_001_a9s=It's risky, but it doesn't look like we can get there without passing right under that Large-scale Weapon.
M1040_S0035_G0030_001_a9s=Let's be careful.
M1040_S0038_G0000_001_a9s=Waaah!!
M1040_S0038_G0010_001_a2b=Damn it!
M1040_S0038_G0020_001_a9s=2B!
M1040_S0038_G0030_001_a9s=I'm displaying the info on their main wiring hub!
M1040_S0038_G0040_001_a9s=Let's get to the Flight Units while we have the chance!
M1040_S0040_G0000_011_op60=The airspace is dangerous due to enemy anti-air weaponry.
M1040_S0040_G0000_300_ysA=...!!
M1040_S0040_G0010_011_op60=Please approach via low-altitude flight.
M1040_S0040_G0010_300_ysA=That's amazing. To think you took this thing down with just ground equipment.
M1040_S0040_G0020_011_a2b=Copy.
M1040_S0040_G0020_300_ysA=Thanks for the support.
M1040_S0040_G0030_021_op210=The airspace is dangerous due to enemy anti-air weaponry.
M1040_S0040_G0030_300_ysB=Y-You guys are incredible...
M1040_S0040_G0040_021_op210=A low-altitude approach is recommended.
M1040_S0040_G0050_021_a9s=Roger that!
M1040_S0040_G0050_300_ysB=You saved us. Thank you.
M1040_S0040_G0060_300_pod042=Proposal: Confirm destination.
M1040_S0040_G0061_300_pod042=Warning: Leaving the operation area will result in increased damage.
