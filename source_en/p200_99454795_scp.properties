M1080_S0080_G0080_201_a9s=Alright.
M1080_S0080_G0090_201_a9s=Next, I just need to unlock the room where 2B is...
M1080_S0080_G0091_201_a9s=That Machine Lifeform... it looks to have higher durability than this unit...
M1080_S0080_G0092_201_a9s=I'll switch bodies via hacking before it notices me.
M1080_S0080_G0100_300_a9s=To get to 2B's room... I should just head to the lower level of the factory...
M1080_S0080_G0110_300_a9s=Dammit! \n...I have to get to 2B, fast.
M1080_S0080_G0120_300_a9s=Shit! \nIt might have been better to switch to a unit with more power...
M1080_S0080_G0150_300_a9s=The wreckage of deactivated robots...
M1080_S0080_G0160_300_a9s=Looks like some are still usable. \nI'll send these coordinates to the Bunker just in case.
M1080_S0080_G0200_300_n02=Stop!!
M1080_S0080_G0210_300_n02=Become God!
M1080_S0080_G0220_300_n02=What are you thinking!? Is your circuit broken!?
M1080_S0080_G0230_300_n02=Become God! Become God! Become God!
M1080_S0080_G0240_300_n02=What on earth has happened to everyone...?
