M1070_S0020_G0000_101_a2b=Bunker, this is 2B. Respond.
M1070_S0020_G0000_300_dbl=...
M1070_S0020_G0010_101_op60=Operator to 2B... 2B-san! Are you alright!?
M1070_S0020_G0010_300_ppl=...
M1070_S0020_G0020_101_a2b=Running a body check. No issues found with basic functions.
M1070_S0020_G0020_300_dbl=Once you get close enough, you can activate the scanner to make it visible.
M1070_S0020_G0030_101_op60=Thank goodness...
M1070_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=Sorry... The terminal's out of order right now.
M1070_S0020_G0040_101_a2b=More importantly, I need a status report.
M1070_S0020_G0050_101_op60=Understood.
M1070_S0020_G0060_101_op60=Regarding the Super-Large-Scale Machine Lifeform that attacked the coast...
M1070_S0020_G0070_101_op60=It ceased functioning eight hours ago, following the attack by you and the others, 2B-san.
M1070_S0020_G0080_101_a2b=Eight hours...
M1070_S0020_G0090_101_op60=The communication facilities in every region are unusable due to the EMP attack...
M1070_S0020_G0100_101_op60=Recovery efforts are currently delayed.
M1070_S0020_G0110_101_op60=Please be careful, as there are areas where data uploading is unavailable.
M1070_S0020_G0120_101_a2b=Where is... 9S?
M1070_S0020_G0130_101_op60=About that...
M1070_S0020_G0140_101_op60=We're getting a faint Black Box signal, but we haven't been able to pinpoint his current location.
M1070_S0020_G0150_101_a2b=If there's a Black Box signal, he has to be alive.
M1070_S0020_G0160_101_a2b=I will commence a search for 9S. Request authorization from the Commander.
M1070_S0020_G0170_101_op60=The Commander has already issued orders to prioritize the search for surviving YoRHa units.
M1070_S0020_G0180_101_op60=Please... find 9S-san.
M1070_S0020_G0190_101_a2b=Roger.
M1070_S0020_G0200_101_a2b=Pod. Search for nearby Black Box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0210_101_pod042=...
M1070_S0020_G0220_101_pod042=Unable to detect Black Box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0230_101_pod042=A special scanner is required to detect faint Black Box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0240_101_a2b=A special scanner?
M1070_S0020_G0250_101_pod042=Record of usage exists at the Resistance Camp.
M1070_S0020_G0260_101_pod042=Recommendation: Obtain information from the Resistance Leader.
M1070_S0020_G0270_101_a2b=Roger.
M1070_S0020_G0280_101_ane=...Hm? You need something?
M1070_S0020_G0290_101_a2b=I'm looking for a special scanner capable of detecting faint Black Box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0300_101_ane=A special scanner... Ah, the machine those two were building.
M1070_S0020_G0310_101_ane=They just got back from an expedition...
M1070_S0020_G0321_101_ane=There's an android with red hair around here. Try asking them.
M1070_S0020_G0330_101_ane=2B.
M1070_S0020_G0340_101_ane=About those red-haired androids...
M1070_S0020_G0350_101_a2b=?
M1070_S0020_G0360_101_ane=No, it's nothing.
M1070_S0020_G0370_101_dbl=...Who the hell are you?
M1070_S0020_G0380_101_ppl=You can't just pick a fight out of nowhere, Devola.
M1070_S0020_G0390_101_dbl=You're too careless, Popola...
M1070_S0020_G0400_101_ppl=I apologize for that. Did you need something?
M1070_S0020_G0410_101_sele=I'm looking for a scanner.
M1070_S0020_G0420_101_sele=No... not really.
M1070_S0020_G0421_101_a2b=I'm looking for a scanner that can detect faint Black Box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0422_101_a2b=No... not really.
M1070_S0020_G0430_101_dbl=Ah... Come to think of it, we did make something like that a while back.
M1070_S0020_G0440_101_dbl=If this'll do, you can have it.
M1070_S0020_G0460_101_ppl=If you install that chip, it should help with your search.
M1070_S0020_G0470_101_ppl=Besides Black Box signals, it also reacts to objects specified in quests,
M1070_S0020_G0480_101_ppl=and other valuable resources... It'll make a sound when it detects things like that.
M1070_S0020_G0490_101_dbl=Well, if it gets annoying, just take the damn thing off.
M1070_S0020_G0500_101_ppl=If you need anything else, just come and ask.
M1070_S0020_G0510_101_dbl=You're better off not gettin' too friendly with us, though...
M1070_S0020_G0520_101_ppl=Devola...
M1070_S0040_G0000_101_a2b=The scanner is already picking up a Black Box signal...
M1070_S0040_G0010_101_a2b=I see. This might actually be useful...
M1070_S0040_G0020_101_pod042=The search target, 9S, was caught in a massive explosion over the ocean.
M1070_S0040_G0030_101_pod042=Proposal: Search for 9S in the Flooded City.
M1070_S0040_G0040_101_a2b=Roger.
M1070_S0040_G0050_101_a2b=Still...
M1070_S0040_G0060_101_a2b=You're rather talkative today, Pod.
M1070_S0040_G0070_101_pod042=Affirmative. I am a Support Unit. I engage in conversation as necessary.
M1070_S0040_G0080_101_pod042=Proposal: 2B should increase her frequency of spontaneous conversation.
M1070_S0040_G0090_101_a2b=...Denied.
M1070_S0040_G0100_101_pod042=Black Box signal is active. Continuation of life functions confirmed.
M1070_S0040_G0110_101_a2b=Pod. Administer a check module and Logic Virus vaccine.
M1070_S0040_G0120_101_ys=Ugh...
M1070_S0040_G0130_101_a2b=I've sent a signal to the Bunker. Rescue should be here soon.
M1070_S0040_G0140_101_ys=Th... Thank you...
M1070_S0040_G0150_101_pod042=We are searching for the accompanying YoRHa unit 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0151_101_pod042=We are searching for the accompanying YoRHa unit 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0152_101_pod042=We are searching for the accompanying YoRHa unit 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0160_101_pod042=If you possess information, request provision of such.

M1070_S0040_G0162_101_pod042=If you possess information, request provision of such.
M1070_S0040_G0170_101_a2b=Any information at all... Please.
M1070_S0040_G0180_101_ys=9S... Ah, the boy who was with you...
M1070_S0040_G0190_101_ys=If you mean him... I think I saw him get blown away during the explosion...
M1070_S0040_G0200_101_pod042=Direction?
M1070_S0040_G0210_101_ys=I'll transfer... the data for the predicted impact point.
M1070_S0040_G0220_101_a2b=Thank you... Rest until the rescue team arrives.
M1070_S0040_G0230_101_a2b=This is... 9S's predicted impact point?
M1070_S0040_G0240_101_pod042=Faint Black Box signal detected.
M1070_S0040_G0250_101_pod042=Receiving signal from the direction of the underground cavern.
M1070_S0040_G0251_101_pod042=Report: Moving away from the position emitting 9S's signal.
M1070_S0040_G0252_101_a2b=Wrong way, huh... Let's go back and see if there's another route.
M1070_S0040_G0260_101_a2b=Did 9S really come this deep inside?
M1070_S0040_G0270_101_pod042=Warning: Possibility of an enemy trap.
M1070_S0040_G0280_101_a2b=...I don't care if it's a trap.
M1070_S0040_G0290_101_a2b=An android's corpse, in a place like this...
M1070_S0040_G0300_101_pod042=No Black Box signal detected.
M1070_S0040_G0330_101_=Ugh... Where am I...?
M1070_S0040_G0340_101_a2b=You're safe now. I've sent a rescue signal to the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0350_101_ys=I'm sorry... I don't know...
M1070_S0040_G0360_101_a2b=Understood. Wait here for rescue.
M1070_S0040_G0370_101_ys=Ugh...
M1070_S0040_G0380_101_ys=Who... am I...?
M1070_S0040_G0390_101_a2b=You were hit by an EMP attack during the operation.
M1070_S0040_G0400_101_ys=I don't... I don't remember anything...
M1070_S0040_G0410_101_a2b=It's okay. I've sent a rescue signal to the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0420_101_ys=I don't know... Anything...
M1070_S0040_G0430_101_a2b=I'm sorry. Please rest here.
M1070_S0040_G0440_101_ys=Who am... I...?
M1070_S0040_G0450_101_ys=...Ugh... Ah...
M1070_S0040_G0460_101_pod042=Black Box signal is active. However, damage to language centers is confirmed.

M1070_S0040_G0520_101_ys=...
M1070_S0040_G0530_101_a2b=No response...
M1070_S0040_G0540_101_pod042=The Black Box shows a faint reaction.
M1070_S0040_G0550_101_a2b=Understood. Contact the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0560_101_pod042=Roger.
M1070_S0040_G0570_101_ys=...
M1070_S0040_G0580_101_ys=Eek... Who are you?
M1070_S0040_G0590_101_a2b=It's okay now. I am...

M5920_S0120_G0000_001_op60=Bunker to 2B-san.
M5920_S0120_G0010_001_a2b=This is 2B.
M5920_S0120_G0020_001_op60=Actually, it seems the Access Points in various regions have broken down.
M5920_S0120_G0030_001_op60=It seems to be an effect of the Super-Large-Scale Machine Lifeform's EMP attack.
M5920_S0120_G0040_001_op60=If you find any broken Access Points during your travels, please repair them.
M5920_S0120_G0050_001_a2b=Roger.
M5920_S0120_G0060_001_pod042=Access Point repair complete.
