M5520_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah... right. There is a matter I would like you to lend a hand with, if possible.
M5520_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=I would like you to collect information on the Old World that is scattered about.
M5520_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=The Old World? Why?
M5520_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=In order to make this village a better place to live, I would like to make effective use of the heritage of the Old World.
M5520_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=Of course, if I find any useful information, I will share it with you as well. Would you be willing to lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Lend strength.
M5520_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Do not lend.
M5520_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=Thank you. When you find any information, please show it to me.
M5520_S0010_G0075_300_pascal=Please let me know if you find any information on the Old World.
M5520_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=Goodness! Knowledge of the Old World should be important to you as well... won't you lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=Please, take pity on this old Machine Lifeform... and lend me your strength?
M5520_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=Please, somehow...
M5520_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=With information on the Old World, the lives of the children in this village will surely become easier... please reconsider.
M5520_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=The Old World information that Pascal wants... is this it?
M5520_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Oh! Thank you... Information about humanity is always so fascinating.
M5520_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=It's not much, but please take this as my thanks...
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such valuable information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is a token of my gratitude. Please, accept it.
M5520_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=It's information on the Old World... but the contents...
M5520_S0020_G0060_001_pod153=Information related to the creation of weapons using nuclear fission.
M5520_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=...Is it really okay to give this to Pascal?
M5520_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Or maybe I should give it to the Commander...
M5520_S0020_G0090_001_pod153=The decision is 9S's to make.
M5520_S0020_G0100_001_pascal=This is...
M5520_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=Thank you. This is valuable information indeed.
M5520_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=Yeah...
M5520_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=Technology like nuclear fission is a lost art for us.
M5520_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=Because it is difficult to control and has a significant impact on the environment, the Creators who made us sealed away all information about it.
M5520_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=Such dangerous information... I cannot possibly accept it...
M5520_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=...I see.
M5520_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=But, thank you for going to the trouble of bringing it to me.
M5520_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=Here is a gift of thanks.
M5520_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=9S-san...
M5520_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=If this village is destroyed because I chose not to build nuclear weapons... will everyone here resent me for it?
M5520_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=...I'm not the one who can decide that.
M5520_S0020_G0220_001_pascal=Yes...
M5520_S0020_G0230_001_cmd=What is it, 9S?
M5520_S0020_G0240_001_a9s=Actually... I found information from the Old World related to nuclear fission.
M5520_S0020_G0250_001_a9s=I was wondering what I should do with it...
M5520_S0020_G0260_001_cmd=Nuclear weapons, you say...
M5520_S0020_G0270_001_cmd=As I'm sure you know, our use of nuclear weapons is restricted by directives from the Council of Humanity.
M5520_S0020_G0280_001_cmd=However, our enemies, the Machine Lifeforms, also refrain from using nuclear weapons, though for reasons we do not know.
M5520_S0020_G0290_001_cmd=We don't know the reason... but in any case, it would be best to secure this information.
M5520_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=Understood.
M5520_S0020_G0310_001_cmd=Good work. This isn't exactly a reward for the intel, but I'll have some maintenance materials sent to your room. Make use of them.
M5520_S0020_G0320_001_a9s=Thank you, Commander.
