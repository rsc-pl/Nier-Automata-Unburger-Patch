M5590_S0010_G0000_001_resistance=Whoa there, walk carefully...
M5590_S0010_G0010_001_resistance=There might be some ancient heritage buried around here.
M5590_S0010_G0020_001_resistance=...Hm? Me? I'm investigating the Old World.
M5590_S0010_G0030_001_resistance=You guys are from YoRHa, huh?
M5590_S0010_G0040_001_resistance=If you find anything that looks like heritage in the desert, bring it to me. I'll make it worth your while, yeah?
M5590_S0010_G0050_001_resistance=If you find anything that looks like heritage from the Old World in the desert, bring it to me. I'll make it worth your while, yeah?
M5590_S0010_G0060_001_a2b=Heritage of the Old World...
M5590_S0010_G0070_001_pod042=Searching for lost items in the desert region is difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0080_001_pod042=Recommendation: Use the Target Scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=Heritage of the Old World...
M5590_S0010_G0100_001_pod153=Searching for lost items in the desert region is difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0110_001_pod153=Recommendation: Use the Target Scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0120_001_a2=Heritage of the Old World, huh...
M5590_S0010_G0130_001_pod042=Searching for lost items in the desert region is difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0140_001_pod042=Recommendation: Use the Target Scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0150_001_resistance=Oh? A new face.
M5590_S0010_G0160_001_resistance=I'm investigating the Old World out here.
M5590_S0010_G0170_001_resistance=If you find anything that looks like heritage in the desert, bring it to me. I'll make it worth your while, yeah?
M5590_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Acquired materials from an ancient era.
M5590_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Hypothesis: A relic of a past civilization.
M5590_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Acquired materials from an ancient era.
M5590_S0020_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis: A relic of a past civilization.
M5590_S0020_G0040_001_resistance=Oh, did you pick up something interesting?
M5590_S0020_G0050_001_resistance=Ho ho... This is a staff.
M5590_S0020_G0060_001_resistance=This is a magnificent piece of heritage! Alright, here's your payment.
M5590_S0020_G0070_001_resistance=It seems... this was a tool used for some kind of ritual. It was probably used by the kingdom that existed around here long ago.
M5590_S0020_G0080_001_resistance=Alriiiight, if you find any other heritage, keep bringing it to me!
M5590_S0030_G0000_001_resistance=Isn't this a stone tablet with the "Rules" written on it? Alright, here's your payment.
M5590_S0030_G0010_001_resistance=There are others like this stone tablet, but...
M5590_S0030_G0020_001_resistance=it seems the kingdom that existed around here had an enormous number of rules.
M5590_S0030_G0030_001_resistance=As the kingdom developed, all sorts of regulations were created.
M5590_S0030_G0040_001_resistance=Because of that, it seems they lived restrictive lives, bound by the rules. Talk about putting the cart before the horse...
M5590_S0030_G0050_001_resistance=Alriiiight, if you find any other heritage, keep bringing it to me!
M5590_S0040_G0000_001_resistance=Ooh, this is a magnificent piece of heritage! Alright, here's your payment.
M5590_S0040_G0010_001_resistance=This is a mask... And from the design, it looks like it was for a woman.
M5590_S0040_G0020_001_resistance=According to legend, the kingdom that existed here was suddenly destroyed at some point.
M5590_S0040_G0030_001_resistance=The reason, apparently, was that the king, who had immense support, suddenly passed away.
M5590_S0040_G0040_001_resistance=This mask might have belonged to the princess...
M5590_S0040_G0050_001_resistance=Alright. If you find any other heritage, keep bringing it to me!
M5590_S0050_G0000_001_robolarge=HEY! Hold it right there! We won't let you pass!
M5590_S0050_G0010_001_robosmall=WON'T LET YOU!
M5590_S0050_G0020_001_robolarge=Leave your money and your lives!
M5590_S0050_G0030_001_robosmall=LEAVE 'EM!
M5590_S0050_G0040_001_a2b=Enemy!
M5590_S0050_G0050_001_a9s=What the?!
M5590_S0050_G0060_001_a2=Dammit!
M5590_S0050_G0070_001_a2b=This enemy...
M5590_S0050_G0080_001_pod042=Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5590_S0050_G0090_001_pod042=Their adornments appear to be an imitation of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0100_001_a2b=Human culture?
M5590_S0050_G0110_001_pod042=They are similar to records called "movies," created for entertainment purposes in the past.
M5590_S0050_G0120_001_pod042=Specifically, a category known as "Westerns," which simulated combat in a certain region.
M5590_S0050_G0130_001_a2b=Combat as entertainment...?
M5590_S0050_G0140_001_a9s=What in the world are these things...
M5590_S0050_G0150_001_pod153=Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5590_S0050_G0160_001_pod153=Their adornments appear to be an imitation of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0170_001_a9s=Human culture...?
M5590_S0050_G0180_001_pod153=They are similar to records called "movies," created for entertainment purposes in the past.
M5590_S0050_G0190_001_pod153=Specifically, a category known as "Westerns," which simulated combat in a certain region.
M5590_S0050_G0200_001_a9s=Combat as entertainment?... I'll never understand how humans thought.
M5590_S0050_G0210_001_a2=What are these things...?
M5590_S0050_G0220_001_pod042=Elimination of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5590_S0050_G0230_001_pod042=Their adornments appear to be an imitation of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0240_001_a2=Human culture?
M5590_S0050_G0250_001_pod042=They are similar to records called "movies," created for entertainment purposes in the past.
M5590_S0050_G0260_001_pod042=Specifically, a category known as "Westerns," which simulated combat in a certain region.
M5590_S0050_G0270_001_a2=Combat as entertainment...? What were humans thinking?
M5590_S0050_G0280_001_resistance=Is this... a statue of a young girl?
M5590_S0050_G0290_001_resistance=...It's engraved with "Wedding Celebration."
M5590_S0050_G0300_001_resistance=This doll of a girl might be in bridal attire.
M5590_S0050_G0310_001_resistance=Speaking of which, there's something I found out from my research.
M5590_S0050_G0320_001_resistance=It seems this place was once called "The City of Masks."
M5590_S0050_G0330_001_resistance=As the name suggests, all the residents of this city apparently lived wearing masks.
M5590_S0050_G0340_001_resistance=The language they used was also different from those around them. Their clothing was unique, too.
M5590_S0050_G0350_001_resistance=Thanks for helping with my investigation. Here, take this!
M5590_S0050_G0360_001_resistance=I wonder what kind of civilization was here... in this place.
