M1060_S0005_G0100_001_a2b=9S. Why did you ask Pascal for information about A2?
M1060_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=Huh...?
M1060_S0005_G0120_001_a2b=Accessing machine lifeforms without permission from Command is not recommended...
M1060_S0005_G0130_001_a9s=...Yeah... I'm sorry.
M1060_S0005_G0140_001_a2b=...But I don't dislike that curious side of you.
M1060_S0005_G0150_001_a9s=...
M1060_S0005_G0160_001_a9s=Thank you, 2B.
M1060_S0005_G0161_001_a2b=The machine lifeforms are our enemy. Don't forget that.
M1060_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Ah, 2B. You've come at a good time.
M1060_S0010_G0010_001_ane=Actually, our Android Army has an aircraft carrier deployed in the Pacific...
M1060_S0010_G0020_001_ane=It will be returning soon to resupply.
M1060_S0010_G0030_001_ane=We in the Resistance will be assisting with the resupply operation.
M1060_S0010_G0040_001_ane=I'd like to ask you two to help with the escort.
M1060_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Escort?
M1060_S0010_G0060_001_ane=Yeah. Supply missiles have been prepared along the coast...
M1060_S0010_G0070_001_ane=but the machine lifeforms have been more active lately, so I figured it'd be best to stay on alert.
M1060_S0010_G0080_001_ane=Of course, if you get orders from your YoRHa unit, feel free to prioritize those.
M1060_S0010_G0090_001_ane=I'm counting on you.
M5920_S0100_G0200_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B-san. It's time for our regular check-in.
M5920_S0100_G0210_001_a2b=This is 2B. No issues.
M5920_S0100_G0220_001_op60=2B-san, you have to hear this! I was looking at image data of flowers today, and...
M5920_S0100_G0230_001_a2b=Flowers?
M5920_S0100_G0240_001_op60=Yes! Among the few records we have in the Bunker, there's a flower called the "Lunar Tear"...
M5920_S0100_G0250_001_op60=I think if you made it into a hair ornament or something, it would look great on someone as cool as you, 2B-san~
M5920_S0100_G0260_001_a2b=Unnecessary.
M5920_S0100_G0270_001_op60=Oh, don't be like that. Being fashionable is part of being a girl.
M5920_S0100_G0280_001_op60=I'll be sure to report back if I find anything else cute, 2B-san!
M5920_S0100_G0290_001_a2b=I don't need that kind of info...
M5920_S0100_G0300_001_op60=This has been Operator 6O. Signing off!
M5920_S0100_G0310_001_a2b=...
M5920_S0100_G0470_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. Commencing regular contact.
M5920_S0100_G0480_001_a9s=Yep, yep. Nothing out of the ordinary here~
M5920_S0100_G0490_001_op210=Roger. Additionally, I am to inform you that the Commander has conveyed her personal praise regarding the recent activities of YoRHa unit 9S.
M5920_S0100_G0500_001_op210=Accordingly, an increase in the production of the Number 9 Model is reportedly under consideration.
M5920_S0100_G0510_001_a9s=Oh... Is that so? That makes me happy.
M5920_S0100_G0520_001_a9s=These results are all thanks to your support, Operator-san. You're so calm, and beautiful...
M5920_S0100_G0530_001_op210=Flattery is unnecessary.
M5920_S0100_G0540_001_op210=That is all.
M5920_S0100_G0550_001_a9s=It wasn't flattery, though...
