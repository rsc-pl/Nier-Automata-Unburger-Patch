M5120_S0010_G0000_001_toolshop=Oh, new faces. New customers are always welcome!
M5120_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Oh... So you're the Resistance's tool shopkeeper?
M5120_S0010_G0020_001_toolshop=Yeah. I make tools by reusing scrap and captured enemy units.
M5120_S0010_G0030_001_toolshop=Buying anything today?
M5120_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=You don't handle Plug-in Chips here?
M5120_S0010_G0050_001_toolshop=Ah, chips for strengthening your body...
M5120_S0010_G0060_001_toolshop=Right now, all chip-related business is on hold due to equipment failure.
M5120_S0010_G0070_001_toolshop=If I just had the materials for repairs, I could handle it, but...
M5120_S0010_G0080_001_toolshop=That's it! If you're willing, could you folks go procure the materials for me?
M5120_S0010_G0090_001_toolshop=My legs are bad, see. If I could move a bit more freely, I'd go look for them myself...
M5120_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=In that case, why don't you repair your own legs first?
M5120_S0010_G0110_001_toolshop=Can't do that. I have to prioritize repairing those who can actually fight.
M5120_S0010_G0120_001_toolshop=Once you folks wipe out the Machine Lifeforms, I'll take my time and fix myself up. So, please!
M5120_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Accept the request.
M5120_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Decline the request.
M5120_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=...Roger.
M5120_S0010_G0160_001_toolshop=I owe you one!
M5120_S0010_G0170_001_toolshop=Okay then, please gather a "Broken Spring," a "Small Gear," and a "Broken Circuit."
M5120_S0010_G0175_001_toolshop=You should be able to get them from enemies in the open area to the left, after you leave this camp.
M5120_S0010_G0180_001_toolshop=I see... Sorry for asking the impossible.
M5120_S0010_G0190_001_toolshop=If you have time later, could you take the request for repair materials?
M5120_S0010_G0200_001_toolshop=Don't forget the requested "Broken Spring," "Small Gear," and "Broken Circuit."
M5120_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Alright, that's everything the tool shopkeeper asked for.
M5120_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Errands are tough work, aren't they~
M5120_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=The Resistance on the surface are important comrades to the YoRHa squadron.
M5120_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=Assisting them is also one of our important missions.
M5120_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=So, do not complain.
M5120_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Yes, ma'am.
M5120_S0030_G0000_001_toolshop=Ooh, you procured the materials. Thank you!
M5120_S0030_G0010_001_toolshop=With this, I can finally sell Plug-in Chips again...
M5120_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=Then why don't you fix your own leg, too? I think there are enough materials...
M5120_S0030_G0030_001_toolshop=Ah, yeah... no...
M5120_S0030_G0040_001_a2b=Is there some other reason you can't repair it?
M5120_S0030_G0050_001_toolshop=...My broken left leg... it's still the original part.
M5120_S0030_G0060_001_toolshop=During this long war, I've repaired this body countless times.
M5120_S0030_G0070_001_toolshop=I swapped parts, and swapped, and swapped, and swapped...
M5120_S0030_G0080_001_toolshop=And the only thing left from the beginning is... just this left leg.
M5120_S0030_G0090_001_toolshop=If I were to replace this, too, I feel like I wouldn't be myself anymore.
M5120_S0030_G0100_001_toolshop=I wonder if I'm still really... "me"...
M5120_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=...
M5120_S0030_G0120_001_toolshop=Ah, sorry for the depressing talk.
M5120_S0030_G0130_001_toolshop=I'll be stocking up properly from now on, so drop by anytime!
