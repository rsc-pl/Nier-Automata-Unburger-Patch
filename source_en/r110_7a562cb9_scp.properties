M6090_S0091_G0000_300_hennawresi=Ah, someone from the YoRHa squad.
M6090_S0091_G0010_300_hennawresi=Hm? ......You mean this thing on my head?
M6090_S0091_G0020_300_hennawresi=This is an electromagnetic wave blocking device I wear on my head to restrict unnecessary information from the secular world.
M6090_S0091_G0030_300_hennawresi=......That's a lie though.
M6090_S0091_G0040_300_hennawresi=So, what do you want? Do you have some worry?
M6090_S0091_G0050_300_hennawresi=It was fun talking...... Come again anytime.
M6090_S0091_G0060_300_hennawresi=If you have any worries I'll listen?
M6090_S0091_G0070_300_hennawresi=Well then, see ya.
M6090_S0091_G0080_300_hennawresi=Ah...... It seems it was tough for the YoRHa people.
M6090_S0091_G0090_300_hennawresi=Now that the Bunker is gone, bodies are no longer supplied.\nTherefore, even if you die, you cannot be "Recovered".
M6090_S0091_G0100_300_hennawresi=If you die it's the end right there,\nso I recommend saving as frequently as possible......
M6090_S0091_G0110_300_sele=How do I save?
M6090_S0091_G0120_300_sele=What is an Access Point?
M6090_S0091_G0130_300_sele=What should I do if I die?
M6090_S0091_G0140_300_sele=Where should I go from here?
M6090_S0091_G0150_300_sele=I get 3D motion sickness......
M6090_S0091_G0160_300_sele=The game is too difficult......
M6090_S0091_G0170_300_sele=Request to unlock "That Thing".
M6090_S0091_G0180_300_sele=No worries.
M6090_S0091_G0190_300_hennawresi=First, I want you to remember that this game cannot Auto-Save.
M6090_S0091_G0191_300_hennawresi=To save, you need to activate that Access Point over there.
M6090_S0091_G0192_300_hennawresi=Once you activate the terminal, you should be able to save anywhere near the terminal.
M6090_S0091_G0200_300_hennawresi=When the antenna on the top right of the screen is up, you can Quick Save from the System Menu.
M6090_S0091_G0201_300_hennawresi=Also, you can return to your YoRHa squad satellite base from the Access Point here.
M6090_S0091_G0202_300_hennawresi=Other Access Points are still under maintenance, but transfer should become possible in due time.
M6090_S0091_G0210_300_hennawresi=I'll say it again, you cannot Auto-Save, so don't forget.
M6090_S0091_G0220_300_hennawresi=The areas where the antenna is effective are limited, but by making Access Points active, you should be able to expand the saveable area.
M6090_S0091_G0230_300_hennawresi=Just in case, I'll say it just one more time, you cannot Auto-Save, okay......
M6090_S0091_G0240_300_hennawresi=An Access Point is a facility prepared for YoRHa squad members.
M6090_S0091_G0250_300_hennawresi=Specifically speaking, it's that thing.
M6090_S0091_G0260_300_hennawresi=At Access Points, you can save data and receive mail.
M6090_S0091_G0270_300_hennawresi=Outside the camp, they are disguised as the wreckage of vending machines.
M6090_S0091_G0280_300_hennawresi=There are various other functions too but...... well, use it and you'll understand.
M6090_S0091_G0290_300_hennawresi=Sometimes, there are terminals that have been attacked by enemies and become unusable, so in those times you should eliminate the enemies.
M6090_S0091_G0300_300_hennawresi=When walking, I think a minimap is displayed on the bottom right.\nThe <MAP_GOAL> inside that is the destination you should go to.
M6090_S0091_G0310_300_hennawresi=Well, if you proceed aiming for the red marker, it'll work out somehow.
M6090_S0091_G0320_300_hennawresi=That is a philosophical and good question.
M6090_S0091_G0330_300_hennawresi=Immediately after a YoRHa unit is destroyed, only the memory data is transferred to a "Body".
M6090_S0091_G0340_300_hennawresi=However, since items are not transferred, if you end up dying, you need to recover Plug-in Chips from your past corpse.
M6090_S0091_G0350_300_hennawresi=If you die again before recovering, the Plug-in Chips will be lost, so be careful.
M6090_S0091_G0360_300_hennawresi=To put it shortly...... It means "Recover your own corpse immediately".
M6090_S0091_G0370_300_hennawresi=Ah, for those system-type consultations, you should ask the Maintenance Shop over there.
M6090_S0091_G0375_300_hennawresi=He undertakes everything from Body maintenance to Pod adjustments.
M6090_S0091_G0380_300_hennawresi=You can change the game difficulty anytime in the System Menu.\nThe gameplay is different for each difficulty, so it might be good to try them out.
M6090_S0091_G0390_300_hennawresi="EASY" weakens enemies, and additionally allows equipping "Auto Chips".\n<KC_LOCKON> activates automatic attacks and automatic evasion.
M6090_S0091_G0400_300_hennawresi="NORMAL" is truly normal difficulty.
M6090_S0091_G0410_300_hennawresi=In "HARD", enemies become stronger, and additionally "Lock-on" becomes unusable.
M6090_S0091_G0420_300_hennawresi=In "VERY HARD", "Lock-on" is unusable, and additionally enemy attack power rises incredibly.
M6090_S0091_G0430_300_hennawresi=......It's a difficulty I don't think is sane, but it seems daredevils choose this.
M6090_S0091_G0431_300_hennawresi=Also, just between us, apparently inside "DATA" -> "Tutorial" there are undisclosed techniques too.
M6090_S0091_G0432_300_hennawresi=When you're so bored you could die, you should take a peek once.
M6090_S0091_G0440_300_hennawresi=Ah, it's you.
M6090_S0091_G0450_300_hennawresi=Actually, I started a business I can't really tell people about......
M6090_S0091_G0460_300_hennawresi=There are titles given to people who really did their best, aren't there...... That......\nWell, I can't say it openly, but that "Thing".
M6090_S0091_G0470_300_hennawresi=Unlocking that "Thing" is difficult, and there are many androids who are troubled.
M6090_S0091_G0480_300_hennawresi=With the cooperation of volunteers from various places, I started a business acting as an agent to unlock that "Thing".
M6090_S0091_G0490_300_hennawresi=It's a secret, but please take a look if you like......
M6090_S0091_G0500_300_hennamresi=Ah, wonderful...... This head is...... wonderful!
M6090_S0091_G0510_300_hennamresi=When I equip these parts, I can see...... I can see the world!
M6090_S0091_G0520_300_hennamresi=Listen to me. Throw a question at me, who has become omniscient and omnipotent!
M6090_S0091_G0530_300_hennamresi=Ask me a question anytime, okay?
M6090_S0091_G0531_300_hennamresi=Ooh, aren't you a Scanner Model from the YoRHa squad......
M6090_S0091_G0532_300_hennamresi=There is nothing I don't know......
M6090_S0091_G0533_300_hennamresi=Is saying too much, but you can ask me about Hacking and various things, okay?
M6090_S0091_G0534_300_hennamresi=Ask me a question again, okay? It's a promise?
M6090_S0091_G0535_300_hennamresi=By all means, ask me a question...... For example, about Hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0540_300_hennamresi=A question...... Ask me a question!
M6090_S0091_G0550_300_hennamresi=Come ask a question again, okay? Being alone is lonely after all!
M6090_S0091_G0560_300_sele=Reading mail is inconvenient......
M6090_S0091_G0570_300_sele=The 3D map is hard to see......
M6090_S0091_G0580_300_sele=How does this world's currency work?
M6090_S0091_G0590_300_sele=What is a Black Box?
M6090_S0091_G0595_300_sele=I want you to tell me about Hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0600_300_sele=No questions.
M6090_S0091_G0610_300_hennamresi=Ah, indeed mail can only be read at Access Points.
M6090_S0091_G0620_300_hennamresi=The reason they don't transmit directly to YoRHa units\nis apparently to prevent important classified information from being stolen.
M6090_S0091_G0630_300_hennamresi=Though, it seems there are many androids who like the retro feel of mail and use it on purpose.
M6090_S0091_G0640_300_hennamresi=Ah, apparently that turns information from satellites into map data but......
M6090_S0091_G0650_300_hennamresi=The resolution of the cameras on the satellite is rough,\nso you can't see fine details or underground.
M6090_S0091_G0660_300_hennamresi=Complaints are coming from other androids too, but apparently nothing can be done.
M6090_S0091_G0670_300_hennamresi=But, walking a bit on your own feet and discovering things is more fun...... or maybe not.
M6090_S0091_G0680_300_hennamresi=Well, give up on it.
M6090_S0091_G0690_300_hennamresi=Basically, we disassemble the wreckage of destroyed enemies, and we use the parts reconstructed from that.
M6090_S0091_G0700_300_hennamresi=Because it's more convenient than going out of our way to dig for iron, right?
M6090_S0091_G0710_300_hennamresi=Value is decided by the weight of that wreckage and the rarity of the parts obtained. That unit is called "G".
M6090_S0091_G0720_300_hennamresi=Eh? How do you read "G"?
M6090_S0091_G0730_300_hennamresi=......That, I can't say. It's Top Secret.
M6090_S0091_G0740_300_hennamresi=Even if you ask "What"...... It's your component after all. I'm not that knowledgeable.
M6090_S0091_G0750_300_hennamresi=A Black Box is a fusion reactor equipped in YoRHa units.
M6090_S0091_G0760_300_hennamresi=However, its structure is not disclosed to us Resistance.\nThere are rumors that some suspicious material is used but......
M6090_S0091_G0770_300_hennamresi=That thing inside your body, if it's okay, I'd like to disassemble and analyze it?
M6090_S0091_G0780_300_hennamresi=......No good, huh. Well, that figures.
M6090_S0091_G0790_300_hennamresi=Since you are a Scanner Model, when you approach an enemy I think <KC_HEAVY_ATK> appears.
M6090_S0091_G0800_300_hennamresi=You can Hack by holding <KC_HEAVY_ATK> but...... there's a little trick to that.
M6090_S0091_G0810_300_hennamresi=If you approach softly from behind so the enemy doesn't notice and Hack......
M6090_S0091_G0820_300_hennamresi=Surprisingly, you can hijack the enemy and operate it remotely.
M6090_S0091_G0830_300_hennamresi=Furthermore, if you Hack another enemy using that enemy, you can do multi-stage hijacking.
M6090_S0091_G0840_300_hennamresi=When infiltrating enemy territory, you can also enter in the form of an inconspicuous Machine Lifeform.
M6090_S0091_G0850_300_hennamresi=Sometime when you feel like it, please try it out.
