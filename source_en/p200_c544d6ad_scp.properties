M1050_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Um...
M1050_S0020_G0000_300_a9s=Let's listen a bit more. We might understand something about Machine Lifeforms.
M1050_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Ah, 9S-san and 2B-san.
M1050_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=The Machine Lifeform rampage the other day was terrible, wasn't it...
M1050_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=There are a few things I want to ask you.
M1050_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Yes. Anything I can answer.
M1050_S0020_G0050_001_sele=Ask about Pascal's pacifism.
M1050_S0020_G0060_001_sele=Ask about the Aliens.
M1050_S0020_G0070_001_sele=Ask about other Machine Lifeforms.
M1050_S0020_G0080_001_sele=Don't ask anything.
M1050_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=I see. If there is anything you are curious about, please ask anytime.
M1050_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=Pascal. Why do you not fight?
M1050_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=...We have been living for hundreds of years.
M1050_S0020_G0120_001_pascal=During that time, we lost comrades again and again.
M1050_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=But, what I was afraid of was not losing comrades.
M1050_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=I became afraid of myself getting used to comrades dying.
M1050_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=That is why... I decided not to fight anymore.
M1050_S0020_G0160_001_a2b=Do you have any information regarding the Aliens?
M1050_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=Aliens... is it. You mean our creators.
M1050_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=But I'm sorry. Actually, I do not know much.
M1050_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=For the last few hundred years, there were no messages from them, and we were fighting independently.
M1050_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=...That's right. The fact that orders from the Aliens stopped coming is also one of the reasons we became pacifists.
M1050_S0040_G0080_001_a2b=...Pascal.
M1050_S0040_G0090_001_pascal=Yes. What is it?
M1050_S0040_G0100_001_a2b=Besides this village, are there Machine Lifeforms disconnected from the network?
M1050_S0040_G0110_001_pascal=Besides this village...
M1050_S0040_G0120_001_pascal=The Songstress at the amusement park that you two defeated the other day was one.
M1050_S0040_G0130_001_a9s=Songstress... that thing?
M1050_S0040_G0140_001_pascal=Ah, also, there are some in the "Forest Country", but...
M1050_S0040_G0150_001_a2b=Forest Country?
M1050_S0040_G0160_001_pascal=Yes. There is a large forest near here,
M1050_S0040_G0170_001_pascal=Machine Lifeforms gathered there and created a country.
M1050_S0040_G0180_001_pascal=It is a very exclusive group, and we cannot even get close...
M1050_S0040_G0190_001_a2b=The location?
M1050_S0040_G0200_001_pascal=It is northeast of the City Ruins.
M1050_S0040_G0210_001_pascal=You should be able to go from the ruins of a large commercial facility...
M1050_S0040_G0220_001_pascal=That area has been dangerous lately, so please be careful.
M1050_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=Forest Country... seems worth investigating.
