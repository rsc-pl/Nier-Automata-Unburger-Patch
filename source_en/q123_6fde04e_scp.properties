M5122_S0010_G0000_300_ane=Sorry, please focus on the mission for now.
M5122_S0010_G0010_300_ane=It's bad of me when you came all this way...
M5123_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Even so, the YoRHa squadron is strong after all. The level is different from us Resistance.
M5123_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Well, we are YoRHa's latest models. Unlike old types like A2—
M5123_S0010_G0020_001_ane=...What?
M5123_S0010_G0030_001_ane=A2... Attacker Number 2...?
M5123_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=Do you know of her?
M5123_S0010_G0050_001_ane=No...
M5123_S0010_G0060_001_ane=...
M5123_S0010_G0070_001_ane=Sorry, but could you listen to one more request?
M5123_S0010_G0080_001_ane=If you have information on that old type YoRHa, A2, I want you to tell me.
M5123_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=We also need information on A2, but... why?
M5123_S0010_G0100_001_ane=...There is something I want to confirm.
M5123_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=Information on A2... even if you say that, where should we look...
M5123_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=How about we investigate energy reactions generated during combat?
M5123_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=When Androids or Machine Lifeforms are destroyed, fusion reactors and such go down,
M5123_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=but we can detect the energy released at that time.
M5123_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=Currently, we should be the only ones on combat missions in this area, so...
M5123_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=I feel there is a high possibility A2 is at the location where there was an energy reaction.
M5123_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=It is concentrated in the factory ruins... I'll point it on the map.
M5123_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=This is...
M5123_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Traces of A2's battle, perhaps.
M5123_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=The crucial A2 signal... doesn't seem to be here.
M5123_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Hm? What is it?
M5123_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=Pod, analysis please.
M5123_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Analysis Result: Deduced to be a data log concerning YoRHa Special Designated Unit, A2.
M5123_S0010_G0240_001_a2b=The content?
M5123_S0010_G0250_001_pod042=Damaged portion is large; further analysis is impossible.
M5123_S0010_G0260_001_a2b=Why... do Machine Lifeforms have A2's information...
M5123_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=There are other reactions. Let's go.
M5123_S0010_G0280_001_ane=This is... data regarding A2!?
M5123_S0010_G0290_001_a2b=The chips were damaged, so we can barely read the contents though.
M5123_S0010_G0300_001_ane=No, even so, it is a harvest.
M5123_S0010_G0310_001_ane=Possibly, there might still be data chips remaining around there.
M5123_S0010_G0320_001_ane=If you find them, please bring them to me.
M5123_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=There are no other data chip reactions. This seems to be the last one.
M5123_S0010_G0340_001_a2b=Pod. After analyzing the recovered data chips, cross-reference them with each chip.
M5123_S0010_G0350_001_pod042=Analysis Complete: Data group containing data regarding A2.
M5123_S0010_G0360_001_pod042=Cross-referencing with other data chips.
M5123_S0010_G0370_001_pod042=Cross-reference Complete: Presumed to be a report regarding the 14th Machine War Pearl Harbor Descent Operation.
M5123_S0010_G0380_001_a2b=Pearl Harbor Descent Operation...?
M5123_S0010_G0390_001_a9s=That's the operation executed by our preceding generation... the old type YoRHa.
M5123_S0010_G0400_001_a9s=For now, we achieved the objective. Let's return to the Resistance Camp.
M5123_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=We brought data regarding A2. Please confirm it.
M5123_S0030_G0010_001_ane=This is...!
M5123_S0030_G0020_001_ane=As I thought, it is that Number 2...
M5123_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=You know her?
M5123_S0030_G0040_001_ane=She is an old type, but she is a YoRHa Number 2 of the same type as you...
M5123_S0030_G0050_001_ane=I have shared an operation with her in the past.
M5123_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=...Pearl Harbor Descent Operation.
M5123_S0030_G0070_001_ane=Yeah.
M5123_S0030_G0080_001_ane=The operation itself was a success. However, the dispatched YoRHa squadron was annihilated.
M5123_S0030_G0090_001_ane=The one commanding that squadron was Number 2... A2.
M5123_S0030_G0100_001_ane=Did you meet her? What is she doing now?
M5123_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=A2... A destruction order has been issued from the Bunker for A2-san.
M5123_S0030_G0120_001_ane=Eh!?
M5123_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=She deserted from the YoRHa squadron, and annihilated the pursuit unit.
M5123_S0030_G0140_001_ane=No way... A2 did...
M5123_S0030_G0150_001_ane=Sorry...
M5123_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=...
M5123_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=...9S, let's go.
M5123_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Anemone-san, I wonder what happened with A2-san...
M5123_S0030_G0190_001_a2b=...There are things that require time to speak about.
M5123_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Even more so for a soldier who has been fighting for a long time.
M5123_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=I suppose so...
M5123_S0030_G0220_001_a2b=9S, you too...
M5123_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=Eh?
M5123_S0030_G0240_001_a2b=...A day might come when you understand too.
M5123_S0030_G0250_001_a9s=...Yes.
