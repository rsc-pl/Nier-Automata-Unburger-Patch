M5120_S0010_G0000_001_toolshop=Oh, new faces. New customers are most welcome!
M5120_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Hee... So you're the Resistance tool shop?
M5120_S0010_G0020_001_toolshop=Yeah. I make tools by reusing scrap and enemy machine bodies we've captured.
M5120_S0010_G0030_001_toolshop=Are you buying something?
M5120_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=You don't handle Plug-in Chips here?
M5120_S0010_G0050_001_toolshop=Ah, chips for strengthening the prosthetic body...
M5120_S0010_G0060_001_toolshop=Right now, we're closed for chip-related business due to equipment failure.
M5120_S0010_G0070_001_toolshop=If I had repair materials, I could handle it, but...
M5120_S0010_G0080_001_toolshop=That's it! If you're willing, could you folks procure the materials for me?
M5120_S0010_G0090_001_toolshop=My legs are bad, see. If I could move a bit more freely, I'd go look for them myself...
M5120_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=In that case, why don't you repair your own legs first?
M5120_S0010_G0110_001_toolshop=Can't do that. I have to prioritize repairing the guys who are actually combat-capable first.
M5120_S0010_G0120_001_toolshop=Once you folks wipe out the Machine Lifeforms, I'll take my time and fix myself up. \nSo, I'm counting on you!
M5120_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Accept the request.
M5120_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Decline the request.
M5120_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=...Roger.
M5120_S0010_G0160_001_toolshop=I'll owe you one!
M5120_S0010_G0170_001_toolshop=Okay then, please gather a "Broken Spring," a "Small Gear," and a "Broken Circuit."
M5120_S0010_G0175_001_toolshop=You should be able to obtain them from enemies in the open area to the left after leaving this camp.
M5120_S0010_G0180_001_toolshop=I see... Sorry for asking the impossible.
M5120_S0010_G0190_001_toolshop=If you have time, could you take the request for repair materials?
M5120_S0010_G0200_001_toolshop=Don't forget the requested "Broken Spring," "Small Gear," and "Broken Circuit."
M5120_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Alright, that's everything the tool shop owner asked for gathered.
M5120_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Menial work is tough, isn't it~
M5120_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=The Resistance on the surface are important brethren to the YoRHa squadron.
M5120_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=Lending them a hand is also an important mission of ours.
M5120_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=So, do not complain.
M5120_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Yees-yes.
M5120_S0030_G0000_001_toolshop=Ooh, you procured the materials for me. I'm grateful!
M5120_S0030_G0010_001_toolshop=With this, I can sell Plug-in Chips...
M5120_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=Then why don't you fix your own leg, too? I think there are enough materials...
M5120_S0030_G0030_001_toolshop=Ah, yeah... no...
M5120_S0030_G0040_001_a2b=Is there some other reason you cannot repair it?
M5120_S0030_G0050_001_toolshop=...My broken left leg is... still the original part.
M5120_S0030_G0060_001_toolshop=During this long war, I've repaired this body many times.
M5120_S0030_G0070_001_toolshop=I swapped parts, and swapped, and swapped, and swapped...
M5120_S0030_G0080_001_toolshop=And the only thing remaining from the beginning is... just this left leg.
M5120_S0030_G0090_001_toolshop=If I exchange this too, I feel like I won't be myself anymore.
M5120_S0030_G0100_001_toolshop=I wonder if I am still really "me"...
M5120_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=...
M5120_S0030_G0120_001_toolshop=Ah, sorry for the depressing talk.
M5120_S0030_G0130_001_toolshop=I'll be stocking up properly from now on, so drop by anytime!
