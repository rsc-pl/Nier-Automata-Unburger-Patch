M5561_S0010_G0000_001_ppl=Oh, welcome.
M5561_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=I'd like to talk leisurely, but I have an errand to run.
M5561_S0010_G0020_001_ppl=I'm sorry for being so frantic. Some necessary materials suddenly came up.
M5561_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=Ah, that's it! Why don't we ask this guy? Right?
M5561_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Ask me... to gather materials?
M5561_S0010_G0050_001_a2=Another material gathering job?
M5561_S0010_G0060_001_ppl=No, that would be bad of us...
M5561_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Go to gather materials.
M5561_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Don't go.
M5561_S0010_G0090_001_dbl=No... Sending Popola on a dangerous material run is painful for me...
M5561_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=I'd really like to ask you for this one favor...
M5561_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=Please manage it somehow, for the sake of my face, I'm begging you!
M5561_S0010_G0120_001_dbl=Wow, that really saves us!
M5561_S0010_G0130_001_ppl=Devola, asking the impossible again...
M5561_S0010_G0140_001_dbl=Well it's fine, isn't it? Let's just honestly accept the kindness here.
M5561_S0010_G0150_001_dbl=Sorry, but could you go get some "Desert Roses"?
M5561_S0010_G0160_001_dbl="Desert Roses" are rare materials that can only be taken in small numbers from old ruins buried in the desert.
M5561_S0010_G0170_001_ppl=...Sorry for the unreasonable request. There are many enemies in the desert, so please be careful.
M5561_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=The "Desert Roses" Devola and the other mentioned are around here, huh.
M5561_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Coming to gather in a place like this is quite a struggle.
M5561_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Why are those two doing such difficult work...
M5561_S0020_G0030_001_a2=The "Desert Roses" the twins mentioned are around here, huh. Coming to gather them like this is a real struggle.
M5561_S0020_G0040_001_a2=...Why are those two doing such difficult work?
M5561_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=This should be enough for the "Desert Roses." Let's return to Devola's place.
M5561_S0020_G0060_001_a2=This is about enough for the "Desert Roses." Let's return to where the two of them are.
M5561_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=Thank you! This many "Desert Roses" is plenty.
M5561_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=Sorry for asking the impossible. But, you really saved us.
M5561_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Those two, they're constantly being made to do grueling labor...
M5561_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis: Grueling tasks will eventually exert a negative influence on the organization.
M5561_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Let's go talk to Anemone-san for a moment.
M5561_S0030_G0050_001_a2=I don't like it. Why are only those twins being made to do grueling labor?
M5561_S0030_G0060_001_pod042=Hypothesis: Grueling tasks will eventually exert a negative influence on the organization.
M5561_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Guess I'll have a word with the leader here...
M5561_S0030_G0080_001_ane=What's wrong? You have a scary look on your face.
M5561_S0030_G0090_001_ane=...Ah, about Devola and Popola.
M5561_S0030_G0100_001_ane=Certainly, only painful jobs are being passed to those two. It's natural to call that irrational.
M5561_S0030_G0110_001_ane=However, there is nothing I can do at my own discretion.
M5561_S0030_G0120_001_ane=...The people around here have not yet forgiven them.
M5561_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Forgiven... for what?
M5561_S0030_G0140_001_a2=Forgiven them for what? And just who the hell are they, anyway?
M5561_S0030_G0150_001_ane=That is...
M5561_S0030_G0160_001_ane=Someday, please hear it from them personally.
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, looking for something?
