M4020_S0000_G0060_300_a9s=It's quite spacious, isn't it?\nIs it okay? Receiving a room like this.
M4020_S0000_G0070_300_a2b=The Leader gave permission, so it should be fine.\nThe surface mission looks like it will be long, so being able to rest in a bed helps.
M4020_S0000_G0070_300_a9s=You're right, let's use it gratefully.
M4020_S0000_G0080_300_a9s=Haa... I'm tiired.
M4020_S0000_G0090_300_a2b=...We're leaving immediately after a short rest.
M4020_S0000_G0100_300_a9s=Yees.
M4020_S0000_G0110_300_a9s=Having a place to come back to is the best, isn't it?
M4020_S0000_G0120_300_a2b=What, all of a sudden.
M4020_S0000_G0130_300_a9s=Just because. I kinda understand the feeling of humans building houses and settling down...
M4020_S0000_G0140_300_a2b=You have a personal room assigned in the Bunker too.
M4020_S0000_G0150_300_a9s=Hmm... The Bunker is somehow restless, you know?
M4020_S0000_G0160_300_a9s=Shall we rest a bit?
M4020_S0000_G0170_300_a2b=Understood...
M4020_S0000_G0180_300_a2b=Let's rest a bit.
M4020_S0000_G0190_300_a9s=Right.
M5140_S0020_G0050_300_a2b=It won't open...
M5140_S0020_G0060_300_a9s=It won't open...
M6010_S0110_G0010_300_pod042=Rest?
