M1060_S0070_G0000_001_a2b=This is... a Machine Lifeform!?
M1060_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=One this big... I've never seen anything like it...
M1060_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=Damn... It's preventing us from getting close with EMP attacks...
M1060_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=We have to attack it by some other method somehow...
M1060_S0070_G0040_011_op60=2B-san! Approval for a direct satellite laser attack has been issued!
M1060_S0070_G0050_011_op60=But, the aim is unstable due to the electromagnetic camouflage generated by the enemy.
M1060_S0070_G0060_011_op60=Please pinpoint the source and destroy it!
M1060_S0070_G0070_011_a2b=You make it sound easy...
M1060_S0070_G0080_011_op60=I'm sorry! But, please do your best!
M1060_S0070_G0131_011_pod042=Confirmed position of EMP generator. Marking on map.
M1060_S0070_G0132_011_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of EMP generator.
M1060_S0070_G0140_011_pod042=Notification: Obtained enemy information from Command.
M1060_S0070_G0150_011_a2b=Open the information.
M1060_S0070_G0160_011_pod042=The giant Machine Lifeform has only one record, confirmed 320 years ago.
M1060_S0070_G0170_011_pod042=After landing, it carried out an ultra-high-intensity electromagnetic wave attack.
M1060_S0070_G0180_011_pod042=In the battle at that time, the Resistance escort unit was annihilated.
M1060_S0070_G0190_011_a2b=In other words, if we don't stop its landing, a tragedy will occur again...
M1060_S0070_G0200_011_pod042=Supporting that deduction.
M1060_S0070_G0210_011_op60=Confirmed disappearance of jamming electromagnetic waves!
M1060_S0070_G0220_011_op60=Satellite laser attack, impacting!
