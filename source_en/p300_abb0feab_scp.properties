M3030_S0040_G0000_001_a2=What is this...
M3030_S0040_G0010_001_a2=The Machine Lifeforms are eating each other...!?
M3030_S0040_G0020_001_a2=Pod! Where is Pascal!?
M3030_S0040_G0030_001_pod042=Unable to confirm due to communication failure.
M3030_S0040_G0040_001_pascal=Ah! A2-san...!
M3030_S0040_G0050_001_a2=What happened!?
M3030_S0040_G0060_001_pascal=I don't know...
M3030_S0040_G0070_001_pascal=Suddenly, some of the villagers went berserk...
M3030_S0040_G0080_001_pascal=And began attacking their comrades.
M3030_S0040_G0090_001_pascal=I managed to let only the children escape to another location, but...
M3030_S0040_G0100_001_pascal=The other villagers...
M3030_S0040_G0110_001_a2=At this rate, you're going to get eaten too!
M3030_S0040_G0120_001_a2=I'll handle things here somehow, so you escape first!
M3030_S0040_G0130_001_pascal=What about you, A2-san!?
M3030_S0040_G0140_001_a2=Like I'd get beaten by small fry like these!
M3030_S0040_G0150_001_a2=Just go!!
M3030_S0040_G0160_001_pascal=Y-Yes!
M3030_S0040_G0161_300_a2=I can't just leave this place as it is...
M3030_S0040_G0170_001_a2=Is that... all of them...
M3030_S0040_G0180_001_a2=Are there any surviving Machine Lifeforms?
M3030_S0040_G0190_001_pod042=Non-existent. All have ceased functioning.
M3030_S0040_G0200_001_a2=I see...
M3030_S0040_G0210_001_a2=Pascal. Can you hear me?
M3030_S0040_G0220_001_pascal=Ah... A2-san.
M3030_S0040_G0230_001_pascal=The village... What happened to everyone in the village?
M3030_S0040_G0240_001_a2=I'm sorry... It was no good.
M3030_S0040_G0250_001_pascal=No...
M3030_S0040_G0260_001_a2=Are the children okay?
M3030_S0040_G0270_001_pascal=I have evacuated them to the Abandoned Factory ruins.
M3030_S0040_G0280_001_a2=Got it. I'll head there for now.
