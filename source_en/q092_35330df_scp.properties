M5092_S0010_G0050_001_robomaskrece=This is a holy place that worships the masks and the rules...
M5092_S0010_G0060_001_robomaskrece=In accordance with Rule 2858, I shall politely explain to our visitor.
M5092_S0010_G0070_001_robomaskrece=This is the place where the Person of the True Mask is chosen.
M5092_S0010_G0080_001_robomaskrece=To become the Person of the True Mask, one must overcome six trials.
M5092_S0010_G0090_001_robomaskrece=If thou possessest the will, let us begin the registration procedure at the reception desk.
M5092_S0010_G0100_001_robomaskrece=Wilt thou challenge the trials?
M5092_S0020_G0010_001_sele=Yes.
M5092_S0020_G0020_001_sele=No.
M5092_S0020_G0025_001_robomaskrece=Then begone.
M5092_S0020_G0030_001_robomaskrece=The trials have six stages: Trial 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, Trial 4, Trial 5, and the Final Trial.
M5092_S0020_G0040_001_robomaskrece=At first, one may only participate in Trial 1. Upon clearing Trial 1, one can challenge Trial 2.
M5092_S0020_G0050_001_robomaskrece=Clear Trial 2 to challenge Trial 3, clear Trial 3 for Trial 4... That is how it works.
M5092_S0020_G0060_001_robomaskrece=That is all for the explanation.
M5092_S0020_G0061_001_robomaskrece=In accordance with Rule 60513, I permit thy challenge to the trials.
M5092_S0020_G0070_001_robomaskrece=Very well, understood.
M5092_S0020_G0075_001_robomaskrece=In this arena, the use of items while challenging a trial is forbidden, so be warned.
M5092_S0030_G0000_001_robomaskmode=In accordance with Rule 61284, thou must break through with "only thine own power"!
M5092_S0030_G0005_001_robomaskmode=Fight fair and square. Begin!
M5092_S0030_G0010_001_robomaskmode=In accordance with Rule 61444, I declare Trial 1 ended.
M5092_S0030_G0010_300_robomaskmode=In accordance with Rule 61446, I declare the trial a failure.
M5092_S0030_G0020_001_robomaskrece=Congratulations. In accordance with Rule 61892, I shall bestow upon thee the reward for clearing Trial 1.
M5092_S0030_G0020_300_robomaskrece=That was regrettable. In accordance with Rule 61891, I recommend thou takest the trial again.
M5092_S0030_G0030_001_robomaskrece=...Thou seemest to wonder why we wear masks.
M5092_S0030_G0030_300_robomaskrece=Which trial dost thou wish to challenge?
M5092_S0030_G0040_001_robomaskrece=It is said that long ago, a kingdom of masked people existed in this land.
M5092_S0030_G0040_300_sele=Trial 1 (Rec. Lv: 25)
M5092_S0030_G0050_001_robomaskrece=By imitating that culture, we are trying to adapt to this land.
M5092_S0030_G0050_300_sele=Trial 2 (Rec. Lv: 35)
M5092_S0030_G0060_300_sele=Trial 3 (Rec. Lv: 50)

M5092_S0030_G0080_300_sele=Trial 5 (Rec. Lv: 70)
M5092_S0030_G0090_001_robomaskmode=Uuhm, Rule 61... er...
M5092_S0030_G0090_300_sele=Trial 6 (Rec. Lv: 80)
M5092_S0030_G0091_001_robomaskmode=That's it! "THOU SHALT FIGHT WITHOUT FLEEING!"
M5092_S0030_G0094_300_sele=Receive explanation of trials
M5092_S0030_G0095_001_robomaskmode=Then, Trial Start!
M5092_S0030_G0095_300_sele=Trial EX (Rec. Lv: 90)
M5092_S0030_G0096_300_sele=Quit
M5092_S0030_G0100_001_robomaskmode=I acknowledge that thou hast magnificently broken through Trial 2!
M5092_S0030_G0100_300_telo=Win without using the Pod.
M5092_S0030_G0110_001_robomaskrece=Congratulations. In accordance with Rule 61892, I shall bestow upon thee the reward for clearing Trial 2.
M5092_S0030_G0110_300_telo=Win without evading.
M5092_S0030_G0120_001_robomaskrece=There are many hardships to living in this land of sand.
M5092_S0030_G0120_300_telo=Destroy all enemies within 3 minutes.
M5092_S0030_G0130_001_robomaskrece=These rules are for that purpose. To make it easier for everyone to live, we are increasing the number of rules.
M5092_S0030_G0130_300_telo=Win in darkness.
M5092_S0030_G0140_001_robomaskmode=Rule 62117: A trial "MUST END WITHIN 3 MINUTES."
M5092_S0030_G0140_300_telo=Win without falling from the blocks.
M5092_S0030_G0145_001_robomaskmode=Then begin!
M5092_S0030_G0150_001_robomaskmode=Magnificent!
M5092_S0030_G0150_300_telo=Win without taking a single hit.
M5092_S0030_G0151_001_robomaskmode=In accordance with Rule 61512, I acknowledge thy breakthrough of Trial 3!
M5092_S0030_G0160_001_robomaskrece=Congratulations. In accordance with Rule 61892, I shall bestow upon thee the reward for clearing Trial 3.
M5092_S0030_G0160_301_telo=Destroy as many enemies as possible within 5 minutes.
M5092_S0030_G0170_001_robomaskrece=Hm? The number of rules, thou askest? I heard it surpassed 124,000 the other day.
M5092_S0030_G0180_001_robomaskrece=We learn from the masked people of old and are constantly increasing the number of rules.
M5092_S0030_G0190_001_robomaskmode=Rule 5493: "THOU SHALT NOT LOSE THYSELF IN THE DARKNESS"...
M5092_S0030_G0191_001_robomaskmode=Do not lose focus... Now, begin!
M5092_S0030_G0200_001_robomaskmode=That is all! In accordance with Rule 61993, Trial 4 is cleared!
M5092_S0030_G0210_001_robomaskrece=Congratulations. In accordance with Rule 61892, I shall bestow upon thee the reward for clearing Trial 4.
M5092_S0030_G0220_001_robomaskrece=Dost thou know? It is said that long ago, one had to fight wolves to survive in this land.
M5092_S0030_G0230_001_robomaskrece=The literature states that the pack's alpha was very wise, and as a result, many residents fell victim.
M5092_S0030_G0240_001_robomaskrece=In any era, to live is to fight.
M5092_S0030_G0250_001_robomaskmode=Rule 5494: "THOU SHALT NOT LET THY FEET TOUCH THE GROUND."
M5092_S0030_G0251_001_robomaskmode=This rule is unreasonable... But, begin!
M5092_S0030_G0270_001_robomaskmode=Magnificent! In accordance with Rule 63710, I acknowledge thy breakthrough of Trial 5!
M5092_S0030_G0280_001_robomaskrece=Congratulations. In accordance with Rule 61892, I shall bestow upon thee the reward for clearing Trial 5.
M5092_S0030_G0290_001_robomaskrece=However, no matter if it is for the sake of peace, it becomes restrictive when the rules increase too much.
M5092_S0030_G0300_001_robomaskrece=If it is like this even for us, I can only imagine the hardship of the people of old...
M5092_S0030_G0310_001_robomaskmode=Rule 64199: "THOU CANST NOT EVEN TOUCH A TRUE HERO!"
M5092_S0030_G0311_001_robomaskmode=This is a difficult trial... May fortune favor thee!
M5092_S0030_G0320_001_robomaskmode=To think... that thou wouldst break through!
M5092_S0030_G0321_001_robomaskmode=By Rule 65123, I name thee victor of the Final Trial!
M5092_S0040_G0000_001_robomaskrece=In accordance with Rule 00028, I recognize thee as One of the True Mask!
M5092_S0040_G0001_001_robomaskrece=First, I shall bestow this "Sand Mask."
M5092_S0040_G0002_001_robomaskrece=Furthermore, as a bonus...
M5092_S0040_G0003_001_robomaskrece=I present these clothes.
M5092_S0040_G0004_001_robomaskrece=They are said to have been worn by... the man who destroyed the world.
M5092_S0040_G0005_001_robomaskrece=Well, the world hasn't been destroyed, so it's likely just a false legend.
M5092_S0040_G0006_001_robomaskrece=In any case, congratulations!
M5092_S0040_G0010_001_robomaskrece=Our "King." That title is fitting for thee who has overcome the trials.
M5092_S0040_G0020_001_robomaskrece=We do not understand what "King" refers to, but that responsibility is frighteningly heavy... apparently.
M5092_S0040_G0030_001_robomaskrece=The "King" must become the foundation of the people, so I ask that thou firmly uphold the rules.
M5092_S0040_G0040_001_robomaskrece=However, tolerance is also necessary at times. Thou must not lose sight of the truth by being too bound by rules.
M5092_S0040_G0050_001_robomaskrece=It seems the kingdom that once stood in this land was ultimately destroyed by the very rules they made themselves...
M5092_S0055_G0010_001_robomaskrece=Our King, we have prepared a new trial.
M5092_S0055_G0012_001_robomaskrece=In this trial, to measure the power of the True King, Auto-Chips and the like have been made unusable.
M5092_S0055_G0014_001_robomaskrece=Please, demonstrate to us the power of the True King.
M5092_S0055_G0020_001_robomaskrece=Currently, at difficulty <difficulty>, the maximum number of kills for Trial EX is <m_count>.
M5092_S0060_G0000_001_robomaskmode=Rule 62305: Thou shalt strive daily and become strong. Now, begin!
M5092_S0060_G0010_001_robomaskmode=That is all!
M5092_S0060_G0020_001_robomaskmode=In accordance with Rule 69406, I declare Trial EX ended.
M5092_S0060_G0025_001_robomaskrece=In this trial, our King defeated <_count> Machine Lifeforms.
M5092_S0060_G0030_001_robomaskrece=In accordance with Rule 69834, I shall bestow a reward.
M5092_S0060_G0035_001_robomaskrece=This mask is proof of the burden allowed only to a hero...
M5092_S0060_G0040_001_robomaskrece=Our King. We await thy next challenge.
