M5095_S0300_G0000_001_n02=Good grief. Organizing past records isn't easy.
M5095_S0300_G0010_001_n02=Overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime... I feel like I'm going to die.
M5095_S0300_G0020_001_n02=Today's material is... Plato 1728, huh.
M5095_S0300_G0030_001_n02=Ah, that's the unit that went berserk...
M5095_S0300_G0100_001_n02=Phew. And with that, the record organization here is complete.
M5095_S0300_G0110_001_n02=Umm, where was the next site again...
M5095_S0300_G0120_001_n02=Record organization in the Server Room, huh.
M5095_S0300_G0130_001_n02=Haaah, I hate that room. The air is so stagnant.
M5095_S0300_G0140_001_n02=Uhm, now where was my terminal?
M5095_S0300_G0150_001_n02=Ah, this is the one.
M6150_S0145_G0000_001_juniorR=Ah, good work, Senpai!! After this, you've got record organization in the Server Room, right!!
M6150_S0145_G0010_001_juniorR=The Server Room is just up ahead!!
M6150_S0145_G0020_001_juniorR=Starting today, I've been assigned as Guide and Traffic Maintenance! It's a pleasure to meet you!!
M6150_S0145_G0030_001_juniorR=Apparently it's easy to get lost around here, and the Management Department got complaints! But now that I've been assigned, you can rest easy!!
