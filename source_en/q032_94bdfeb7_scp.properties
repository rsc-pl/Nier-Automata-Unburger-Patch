M5031_S0020_G0100_300_a2b=Now is not the time to be repairing this thing.
M5031_S0030_G0195_001_a9s=To connect the memory regions, I'd like to get four "Pristine Screws" and a "Large Gear."
M5031_S0030_G0201_001_a2b=This robot...
M5031_S0030_G0202_001_a9s=Ah, a broken robot. Looks like we could fix it with a little work.
M5031_S0030_G0205_001_a2b=Understood.
M5032_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=Did you learn anything from the factory information?
M5032_S0010_G0000_300_a2b=Assuming we get the "Pristine Screws" from Large Bipeds, what about the "Large Gear"?
M5032_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=No, just their manufacturing process...
M5032_S0010_G0010_300_a9s=When in trouble, we turn to our Operator.
M5032_S0010_G0020_001_a2b=There's still so much we don't understand about the Machine Lifeforms.
M5032_S0010_G0020_300_a9s=Operator-san, we're looking for a "Large Gear." Could you tell us where we can get one?
M5032_S0010_G0030_001_a2b=We need to collect whatever information we can get.
M5032_S0010_G0030_300_op210=What are you up to this time? ...Well, fine. There are records of "Large Gears" being obtained from Small Machine Lifeforms.
M5032_S0010_G0040_300_op210=Though it seems usable ones are rarely obtained because they're severely damaged upon destruction.
M5032_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=With this, we have all the parts to repair that Large-Scale Weapon.
M5032_S0010_G0050_300_a9s=I see... Thank you for the information.
M5032_S0010_G0055_001_telo=53 minutes later...
M5032_S0010_G0060_300_a2b=So for now, we should just keep destroying Small Machine Lifeforms?
M5032_S0010_G0070_300_a9s=...You really are rough, 2B.
M5032_S0010_G0080_300_a2b=...We're not having much luck gathering materials.
M5032_S0010_G0090_300_a9s=They were all too damaged to be of any use.
M5032_S0010_G0100_300_a2b=Can't we use them even if they're a little broken...?
M5032_S0010_G0110_300_a9s=Don't be unreasonable.
M5032_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=With this... all right...
M5032_S0020_G0010_001_eng=My Name Is "Engels". Manufacturing Number 110-B.
M5032_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Whoa!
M5032_S0020_G0030_001_eng=Manufactured In February 11934, Human Era.
M5032_S0020_G0040_001_eng=First Sortie In August Of The Same Year.
M5032_S0020_G0050_001_eng=Confirmation Of Current Situation Is Required.
M5032_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=You startled me, speaking all of a sudden...
M5032_S0020_G0070_001_eng=Confirmation Of Current Situation Is Required.
M5032_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=...You were defeated by us androids, and are currently unable to move.
M5032_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Quietly hand over any classified information you possess.
M5032_S0020_G0100_001_eng=Understood.
M5032_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=You're handing it over awfully easily...
M5032_S0020_G0120_001_eng=My Mission Has Already Been Accomplished, And I Currently Have No Commander.
M5032_S0020_G0130_001_eng=I Have Also Not Received Orders To Protect Classified Information.
M5032_S0020_G0140_001_eng=However, As A Combat Weapon, This Unit Does Not Possess Much Information.
M5032_S0020_G0150_001_eng=Do Not Expect Much.
M5032_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=I see...
M5032_S0020_G0170_001_eng=I Thank You For Helping Me.
M5032_S0020_G0180_001_a2b=We didn't really "help" you...
M5032_S0020_G0190_001_eng=If You Would, Please Drop By Again.
M5032_S0020_G0200_001_a2b=Why?
M5032_S0020_G0210_001_eng=Because I Am Bored.
M5032_S0020_G0220_001_a9s=Bored...
M5032_S0020_G0230_001_a9s=That was a strange robot...
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location info obtained. Marking on map.
