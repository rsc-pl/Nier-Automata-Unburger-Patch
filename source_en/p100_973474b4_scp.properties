M1010_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=9S...
M1010_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=The hangar's this way. Let's go.
M1010_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=On the Commander's orders, I've been assigned to handle your maintenance, 2B-san.
M1010_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=I'll be performing periodic checks on you from now on.
M1010_S0030_G0020_300_a9s=2B-san, do you have enough supplies?\nIf not, you can restock at the terminal in your room.
M1010_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=...I see.
M1010_S0030_G0030_300_a9s=Come to think of it... do I have enough supplies?
M1010_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=No need to worry, though. Us 9S models are famous for being top-of-the-line.
M1010_S0030_G0040_300_a2b=Why don't you go restock over there?
M1010_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=...Then again, I probably shouldn't be the one saying that.
M1010_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M1010_S0030_G0060_300_a9s=This is my room.\nPlease feel free to stop by whenever you like.
M1010_S0030_G0061_001_a2b=...9S.
M1010_S0030_G0062_001_a9s=Huh? What is it?
M1010_S0030_G0063_001_a2b=The honorific is unnecessary.
M1010_S0030_G0064_001_a9s=Huh?
M1010_S0030_G0065_001_a2b=...You don't need to add "-san" to my name.
M1010_S0030_G0066_001_a9s=R-Right... Understood.
M1010_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=...Oh, right.
M1010_S0030_G0070_300_a9s=Well, there's nothing here, but still.
M1010_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=The Commander was asking for you, so let's go together.
M1010_S0030_G0080_300_a2b=Did you forget something?
M1010_S0030_G0085_001_a9s=2B-sa... no, 2B.
M1010_S0030_G0090_001_cmd=Ah, 2B.
M1010_S0030_G0100_001_cmd=Is your maintenance complete?
M1010_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=Yes.
M1010_S0030_G0120_001_cmd=That business with the Black Box runaway you used to annihilate the enemy...
M1010_S0030_G0130_001_cmd=Try not to be so reckless.
M1010_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=...Yes.
M1010_S0030_G0150_001_cmd=Apologies for this right after maintenance, but you have a mission.
M1010_S0030_G0160_001_cmd=Rendezvous with the Resistance on the surface and gather intelligence.
M1010_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=Huh? Wasn't another YoRHa member already assigned as liaison to the Resistance...?
M1010_S0030_G0180_001_cmd=We've lost contact with the previous operative.
M1010_S0030_G0190_001_cmd=I want you to investigate the cause as part of your field survey.
M1010_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Roger that.
M1010_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=The surface... that means we'll be taking a Flight Unit.
M1010_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Let's head to the hangar.
M1010_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=The operating costs for the Flight Units are so high, they barely ever let us use them...
M1010_S0030_G0240_001_a9s=You'd think they'd just produce some cheaper models.
M5920_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=You can't save your data unless you're near an Access Point.
M5920_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Check the local map and be sure to save often.
