M5031_S0020_G0100_300_a2b=Now is not the time to be repairing this guy.
M5031_S0030_G0195_001_a9s=To connect the memory regions together, I'd like to obtain 4 "Pristine Screws" and a "Large Gear."
M5031_S0030_G0201_001_a2b=This robot...
M5031_S0030_G0202_001_a9s=Ah, it's a broken robot. It looks like it can be repaired if we work on it a bit.
M5031_S0030_G0205_001_a2b=Understood.
M5032_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=Was there anything you learned from the factory information?
M5032_S0010_G0000_300_a2b=Assuming we get "Pristine Screws" from Large Bipeds, what about the "Large Gear"?
M5032_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=No, just their manufacturing process...
M5032_S0010_G0010_300_a9s=It's Operator-san for times of trouble.
M5032_S0010_G0020_001_a2b=There are still many things we don't understand about Machine Lifeforms.
M5032_S0010_G0020_300_a9s=Operator-san, we're looking for a "Large Gear," could you tell us where we can obtain one?
M5032_S0010_G0030_001_a2b=No matter what the information is, we have to collect it.
M5032_S0010_G0030_300_op210=What are you doing this time? ...Well, fine. There are records of "Large Gears" being obtained from Small Machine Lifeforms.
M5032_S0010_G0040_300_op210=Though it seems usable ones are rarely obtained because damage upon destruction is severe.
M5032_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=With this, all the parts to repair that Large-Scale Weapon are gathered.
M5032_S0010_G0050_300_a9s=I see... Thank you for providing the information.
M5032_S0010_G0055_001_telo=53 minutes later...
M5032_S0010_G0060_300_a2b=For now, we should just keep defeating Small Machine Lifeforms?
M5032_S0010_G0070_300_a9s=...You really are rough, 2B.
M5032_S0010_G0080_300_a2b=...We're not gathering materials very well.
M5032_S0010_G0090_300_a9s=They were all unusable because the damage was too severe.
M5032_S0010_G0100_300_a2b=Can't we use them even if they're a little broken...
M5032_S0010_G0110_300_a9s=Don't be unreasonable.
M5032_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=With this... Okay...
M5032_S0020_G0010_001_eng=My Name Is "Engels". Manufacturing Number 110-B.
M5032_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Wah!
M5032_S0020_G0030_001_eng=Manufactured In February 11934, Human Era.
M5032_S0020_G0040_001_eng=First Sortie In August Of The Same Year.
M5032_S0020_G0050_001_eng=Confirmation Of Current Situation Required.
M5032_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=That surprised me, speaking all of a sudden...
M5032_S0020_G0070_001_eng=Confirmation Of Current Situation Required.
M5032_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=...You were defeated by us androids, and currently cannot move.
M5032_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Hand over the classified information you possess quietly.
M5032_S0020_G0100_001_eng=Understood.
M5032_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=He's handing it over awfully easily...
M5032_S0020_G0120_001_eng=My Mission Has Already Been Accomplished, And Currently There Is No Commander.
M5032_S0020_G0130_001_eng=I Have Not Received Orders To Protect Secrets Either.
M5032_S0020_G0140_001_eng=However, Information On This Unit, Which Is A Combat Weapon, Is Not That Plentiful.
M5032_S0020_G0150_001_eng=Do Not Expect Much.
M5032_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=I see...
M5032_S0020_G0170_001_eng=I Thank You For Helping Me.
M5032_S0020_G0180_001_a2b=We didn't particularly help you...
M5032_S0020_G0190_001_eng=If It Is Fine With You, Please Drop By Again.
M5032_S0020_G0200_001_a2b=Why?
M5032_S0020_G0210_001_eng=Because I Am Bored.
M5032_S0020_G0220_001_a9s=Bored...
M5032_S0020_G0230_001_a9s=That was a strange robot...
