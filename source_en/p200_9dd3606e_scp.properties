M1090_S0230_G0000_001_a9s=Dammit! Enemies here too!
M1090_S0230_G0010_001_pascal=9S-san!
M1090_S0230_G0020_001_pascal=It seems all the Machine Lifeforms connected to the network have gone berserk...
M1090_S0230_G0030_001_pascal=We've sealed the village entrance and are trying to fight them off, but,
M1090_S0230_G0040_001_pascal=with our weaponry...
M1090_S0230_G0050_001_a2b=First, we eliminate these.
M1090_S0230_G0060_001_pascal=Thank you... You saved us.
M1090_S0230_G0070_001_a2b=What happened here?
M1090_S0230_G0080_001_pascal=Every Machine Lifeform connected to the network went berserk simultaneously.
M1090_S0230_G0090_001_pascal=I presume the central unit controlling everything has gone out of control.
M1090_S0230_G0100_001_a9s=That... Machine Lifeform named "Eve."
M1090_S0230_G0110_001_a2b=If we destroy the control unit, will all of them stop?
M1090_S0230_G0120_001_pascal=Most likely...
M1090_S0230_G0130_001_a2b=Pod! Can you pinpoint Eve's location?
M1090_S0230_G0140_001_pod042=Report: Location has been identified. Marking coordinates on map.
M1090_S0230_G0150_001_a2b=We'll defeat Eve.
M1090_S0230_G0160_001_a9s=Pascal, you protect the village!
M1090_S0230_G0170_001_pascal=Please be careful!
M1090_S0230_G1060_001_pascal=Thank you... You saved us.
M1090_S0230_G1080_001_pascal=Every Machine Lifeform connected to the network went berserk simultaneously.
M1090_S0230_G1090_001_pascal=I presume the central unit controlling everything has gone out of control.
M1090_S0230_G1120_001_pascal=Most likely...
