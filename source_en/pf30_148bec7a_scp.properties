M4100_S0010_G0000_300_unknown=The YoRHa squadron was annihilated...\nThus, the Earth transformed into a paradise for the robots...
M4100_S0020_G0000_300_unknown=The YoRHa squadron is forced into a disadvantage by Machine Lifeforms unleashing Super-Large-Scale Weapons.\nThe annihilation of the YoRHa squadron is likely only a matter of time. The path to humanity's glory has been cut off.
M4100_S0030_G0000_300_unknown="I can no longer suppress my curiosity about Machine Lifeforms. I will go independent and research them as I please." Leaving these words behind, 9S disappeared.
M4100_S0040_G0000_300_unknown=Due to the abandonment of mission by 2B and 9S, the City Ruins and Resistance Camp suffered a devastating blow.
M4100_S0040_G0010_300_unknown=The annihilation of the YoRHa squadron is likely only a matter of time.
M4100_S0050_G0000_300_unknown=After 2B left, 9S continued to wait for her for several decades.\nHowever, 2B never appeared again.
M4100_S0060_G0000_300_unknown=Due to 2B suddenly throwing a tantrum, the Machine Lifeforms were wiped out.\nPeace was never established with the androids...
M4100_S0070_G0000_300_unknown=Unable to suppress curiosity, the android ate the horse mackerel.\nImmediately, body fluids began to coagulate, and they could feel muscles all over their body seizing up.
M4100_S0070_G0010_300_unknown=...It is certainly delicious. One can nod in agreement that humanity used it for food.\nIn their fading consciousness, the android thought of such things.
M4100_S0080_G0000_300_unknown=Sick of everything, 2B abandoned her mission and decided to go fishing at the coast right then and there. That's it, let's become a fisherman. 2B's face was wearing a bright, beaming smile.
M4100_S0080_G0010_300_unknown=Ten years since fleeing the battlefield. 2B became a target hunted by both Machine Lifeforms and the YoRHa assassination unit. However, she seems to be enjoying her life on the run.
M4100_S0090_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like going for a short walk.\nBy the time she was satisfied, Pascal's Village had long since perished.
M4100_S0100_G0000_300_unknown=Due to a berserk android, the village of Machine Lifeforms with no hostility was annihilated.
M4100_S0100_G0010_300_unknown=Thus, the peaceful Machine Lifeforms were exterminated. They say that from inside the village where no one goes anymore, the laughing voice of an android can be heard occasionally.
M4100_S0110_G0000_300_unknown=A portion of the YoRHa units abandoned the operation. As a result, the android army collapsed, and the surface became a paradise for Machine Lifeforms.
M4100_S0110_G0010_300_unknown=The whereabouts of the escaped YoRHa units remain unknown to this day...
M4100_S0120_G0000_300_unknown=The virus had penetrated even 2B's central nervous system.\nHaving lost her reason, she continued to wander the ruins until her power ran out.
M4100_S0130_G0000_300_unknown=9S suddenly lost interest in 2B.\nThe reason is unknown, but in any case, he lost interest in everything.
M4100_S0140_G0000_300_unknown=A2, having thought of something, suddenly began destroying Machine Lifeforms.\nPascal watched that figure in dumbfounded amazement.
M4100_S0150_G0000_300_unknown=Leaving the struggling Devola and Popola behind, 9S walked away.\nOf course, Devola and Popola died.
M4100_S0160_G0000_300_unknown=[DANGER] [HANDLE WITH CARE]\nThe OS Chip must never be removed. Removing it results in death.

M4100_S0180_G0000_300_unknown=For some reason, 9S aborted the hacking of the Tower and began cheering for the fighting Devola and Popola. Naturally, they were overwhelmed by numbers in the end, and the three were crushed to death.
M4100_S0200_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like going for a short walk.\nBy the time she was satisfied, 2B had been completely gnawed away by Machine Lifeforms and was gone.
M4100_S0210_G0000_300_unknown=The berserk Emils caused the fusion reactors to go out of control.\nThis Earth ended up becoming a planet where living things can no longer dwell.
M4100_S0220_G0000_300_unknown=A2 destroyed Pascal. Afterward, due to Pascal's death, the village of Machine Lifeforms collapsed and went berserk, resulting in the annihilation of androids on the surface.
