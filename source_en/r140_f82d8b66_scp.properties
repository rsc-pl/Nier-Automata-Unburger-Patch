M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=STOP! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=WE WON'T FIGHT! WE WON'T FIGHT!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=DON'T KILL US! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We didn't do anything wrong...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=WE'RE SORRY! WE'RE SORRY!
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Oh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0100_300_villager=This is our village. I am protecting the village's safety.
M6050_S0010_G0110_300_villager=I wonder if it's time for the guard shift change yet...
M6050_S0010_G0120_300_villager=Welcome to our village...
M6050_S0010_G0130_300_villager=Please take your time...
M6050_S0010_G0140_300_kj=Glad you came. No one in this village likes conflict, but we keep weapons stocked just in case.
M6050_S0010_G0150_300_kj=If you're curious, wanna take a look?
M6050_S0010_G0160_300_kj=You're here again? Make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G0170_300_kj=I was taught how to make 'em by the legendary swordsmith who lives in the forest.
M6050_S0010_G0180_300_kj=It'd be nice if he came to the village, too.
M6050_S0010_G0190_300_kj=I like peace, but I also like weapons... It's a contradiction.
M6050_S0010_G0200_300_kj=Come visit again anytime.
M6050_S0010_G0210_300_sp=Welcome. Is there something you want?
M6050_S0010_G0220_300_sp=Please come again anytime. There is no need to hesitate.
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0240_300_villager=What is it about Sartre-san that's so great...? Do you have any idea?
M6050_S0010_G0250_300_villager=The charm of Sartre-san... I do not understand it.
M6050_S0010_G0260_300_villager=...A three-tiered belly, so cool.
M6050_S0010_G0270_300_villager=Someday, I'm gonna get more tiers on my belly too.
M6050_S0010_G0280_300_villager=I'm keeping watch for any weirdos trying to get into the village.
M6050_S0010_G0290_300_villager=This path connects to the castle in the forest.
M6050_S0010_G0310_300_villager=This is a nice, quiet place...
M6050_S0010_G0320_300_villager=It is solitude that makes one strong.
M6050_S0010_G0330_300_villager=Don't you agree that it's important to make time to be alone?
M6050_S0010_G0340_300_villager=Well, it's not like I'm a person, though.
M6050_S0010_G0350_300_villager=...It's not that I don't have any friends.
M6050_S0010_G0360_300_pascal=Those who are here harbor no hostility. They are all gentle villagers.
M6050_S0010_G0370_300_pascal=Watching the children play with such energy is my daily routine.
M6050_S0010_G0380_300_villager=Uncle Pascal! Let's play!
M6050_S0010_G0390_300_villager=Play with us!... Play!
M6050_S0010_G0400_300_villager=Alright, but in exchange, you must do your studies properly as well.
M6050_S0010_G0410_300_villager=Can you promise me that?
M6050_S0010_G0420_300_villager=Yeah, I'll study! Later!
M6050_S0010_G0430_300_villager=Later, I'll do it later!
M6050_S0010_G0440_300_villager=What should we play, I wonder...
M6050_S0010_G0450_300_villager=I didn't think about it.
M6050_S0010_G0460_300_villager=Playing is just another form of studying.
M6050_S0010_G0470_300_villager=You think so too, right?
M6050_S0010_G0480_300_villager=I can already play by myself.
M6050_S0010_G0490_300_villager=Always calling for "Uncle Pascal"... those guys are such children.
M6050_S0010_G0500_300_villager=...What is it... Do you want to play with me?
M6050_S0010_G0510_300_villager=If you absolutely insist... I guess that's fine?
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is just as Sartre-san says.
M6050_S0010_G0570_300_villager=I'm what you'd call an indoor type.
M6050_S0010_G0580_300_villager=I like the view I get while lazing around at home.
M6050_S0010_G0590_300_villager=I love the outdoors so much I could die.
M6050_S0010_G0600_300_villager=It feels amazing to fly through the forest listening to the rustling trees.
M6050_S0010_G0610_300_villager=Well, I suppose someone who can't fly wouldn't understand.
M6050_S0010_G0620_300_villager=The view from the sky is the best.
M6050_S0010_G0630_300_villager=Hey! I like high places!
M6050_S0010_G0640_300_villager=Do you like high places too? The view from here is wonderful!
M6050_S0010_G0650_300_villager=Uncle Pascal said it's too dangerous, but I'd really like to visit that forest castle over there.
M6050_S0010_G0660_300_villager=Uncle Pascal made a slide for us!
M6050_S0010_G0670_300_villager=This is addictive! You'll get hooked!
M6050_S0010_G0680_300_villager=So this is the rumored "slide."
M6050_S0010_G0690_300_villager=It is extremely... intriguing.
M6050_S0010_G0700_300_villager=I will observe the situation a little longer before I slide.
M6050_S0010_G0710_300_villager=I-It's not that I'm scared!
M6050_S0010_G0780_300_villager=What should we do today?
M6050_S0010_G0790_300_villager=Tag!
M6050_S0010_G0800_300_villager=Ummm... Ummm, Jump Rope!
M6050_S0010_G0810_300_villager=Jump Rope? Let's do it!
M6050_S0010_G0820_300_villager=But, are my legs... long enough?
M6050_S0010_G0830_300_villager=......
M6050_S0010_G0840_300_villager=...The world is a harsh place.
M6050_S0010_G0850_300_villager=I guess we'll just play Tag after all...
M6050_S0010_G0860_300_villager=I wanna... play Jump Rope.
M6050_S0010_G0870_300_villager=My body may be big, but my feelings are very small...
M6050_S0010_G0880_300_villager=Please don't bully me, okay?
M6050_S0010_G0881_300_villager=Man, I wish I was big like that guy.
M6050_S0010_G0882_300_villager=If only I had a bigger body... don't you think so?
M6050_S0010_G0883_300_villager=More... Grant me more mighty power...
M6050_S0010_G0884_300_villager=If only I had a giant body, I could destroy everything...
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible!
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Another fine day, isn't it?
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you need anything, please let me know.
M6050_S0010_G3030_300_villager=Today, take me to the top of the village, to the front of the forest castle, and to Uncle Pascal's place!
M6050_S0010_G3040_300_villager=After that, to the village entrance, and the bridge that goes to the amusement park!
M6050_S0010_G3050_300_villager=This guy can't climb to high places, so I carry him around. But my arms get so tired from carrying him around to play every day.
M6050_S0010_G3060_300_villager=Next time, I'm going to have Uncle Pascal teach him the meaning of the word "restraint".
