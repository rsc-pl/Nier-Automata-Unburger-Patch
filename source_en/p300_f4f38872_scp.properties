M5224_S0010_G0000_001_n02=...I really, truly respect Pascal-san.
M5224_S0010_G0010_001_n02=Building this village for outcasts like us... I can't thank him enough...
M5224_S0010_G0020_001_n02=Aaaah! I want to give my thanks to my benefactor, Pascal-san...
M5224_S0010_G0030_001_n02=...I really want to thank him, you knooow? (Glance)
M5224_S0010_G0040_001_sele=It seems to want to say something, so I'll ask.
M5224_S0010_G0050_001_sele=This looks like a pain, so I'll ignore it.
M5224_S0010_G0060_001_a2=Looks like you have something to say...
M5224_S0010_G0070_001_n02=That's exactly right! The feeling of wanting to present a gift of thanks to Pascal-san exists within me!
M5224_S0010_G0080_001_n02=Apparently, there's a philosophy book that Pascal-san likes over at the Resistance Camp...
M5224_S0010_G0090_001_sele=I'll go get it for you.
M5224_S0010_G0100_001_sele=That's none of my business.
M5224_S0010_G0110_001_a2=Can't be helped... Pascal has helped me out. I'll go get that philosophy book.
M5224_S0010_G0120_001_n02=Really!? I'm so grateful!
M5224_S0010_G0130_001_n02=I hear a person named "Anemone" at the Resistance Camp is hoarding the philosophy books, so go steal one for me!
M5224_S0010_G0140_001_a2=Like hell I'm doing something that reckless...
M5224_S0020_G0150_001_ane=Hmm...? Pascal wants a philosophy book?
M5224_S0020_G0160_001_ane=Ah, I have one I just finished reading.
M5224_S0020_G0170_001_ane=If this one will do, take it.
M5224_S0020_G0180_001_a2=Sorry for the trouble.
M5224_S0020_G0181_001_ane=While you're at it, could you pass this "Gold Ore" to Pascal? He asked for it a while back, and I finally got my hands on some.
M5224_S0020_G0182_001_a2=Understood.
M5224_S0020_G0190_001_ane=Still, a Machine Lifeform reading a philosophy book...
M5224_S0020_G0200_001_ane=Perhaps we don't understand anything about our enemy at all.
M5224_S0020_G0210_001_a2=...I suppose not.
