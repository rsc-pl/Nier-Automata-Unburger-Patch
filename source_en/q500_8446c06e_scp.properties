M5500_S0010_G0000_001_andwoman=...!
M5500_S0010_G0010_001_andman=Dammit! This is bad...!
M5500_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=H-Hey, you two.
M5500_S0010_G0030_001_andwoman=Please, let us go!
M5500_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Um... are you misunderstanding something?
M5500_S0010_G0050_001_andman=...You didn't come here to capture us?
M5500_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=Of course not!
M5500_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=What exactly happened?
M5500_S0010_G0080_001_andwoman=...We deserted. From the Resistance Camp.
M5500_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=You deserted?!
M5500_S0010_G0100_001_andman=We're sick of fighting! We just want to live a quiet life, just the two of us!
M5500_S0010_G0110_001_andwoman=Please... keep it a secret that we're here, okay?
M5500_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=We are YoRHa. We're a different organization from the Resistance.
M5500_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=We have no obligation to report on your activities.
M5500_S0010_G0140_001_andwoman=Oh, thank goodness...
M5500_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=But if you stay here, you'll be found eventually, you know...?
M5500_S0010_G0160_001_andman=We know. But my body isn't working right. We don't have the parts for maintenance...
M5500_S0010_G0170_001_andwoman=Um, this might be incredibly forward of me, but... could you bring us the materials we need for maintenance?
M5500_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=Huh? You want us to?
M5500_S0010_G0190_001_andwoman=We can't exactly go moving around ourselves.
M5500_S0010_G0200_001_andwoman=We'll make it worth your while... Please!
M5500_S0010_G0210_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5500_S0010_G0220_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5500_S0010_G0230_001_andwoman=Oh, thank you. We need an "Elaborate Gadget" for the maintenance.
M5500_S0010_G0240_001_andwoman=I saw one near the Abandoned Factory before.
M5500_S0010_G0250_001_andman=We're trusting you. We're counting on you.
M5500_S0010_G0260_001_andman=I'm sure the Resistance will send pursuers here, too. And all we want is to live a quiet life together...
M5500_S0010_G0270_001_andwoman=Could you bring us the materials for maintenance? If you do, we'll leave this place... Please!
M5500_S0020_G0000_001_andwoman=Ah, this is it! With this, we can do the maintenance!
M5500_S0020_G0010_001_andman=Thank you. I'm glad we trusted you.
M5500_S0020_G0020_001_andman=Once the maintenance is finished, we'll leave. Please, pray for our safety.
M5500_S0020_G0030_001_n02=The androids who were here have already left, I see.
M5500_S0020_G0035_001_n02=I'd like to go across the sea, too...
M5500_S0020_G0040_001_n02=I hope they're safe somewhere... I pray for their happiness.
M5500_S0020_G0050_001_andman=Do you remember us? You helped us...
M5500_S0020_G0060_001_andman=You really saved us back then. Thank you.
M5500_S0020_G0070_001_andwoman=...Actually, I have a favor to ask, if that's okay?
M5500_S0020_G0080_001_andman=Idiot, stop it! Don't involve them any further!
M5500_S0020_G0090_001_andwoman=But...
M5500_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Is something wrong? Do you need more repair materials?
M5500_S0020_G0110_001_andman=No, it's just...
M5500_S0020_G0120_001_andwoman=What good is having some stupid pride? It's a fact that we're in trouble.
M5500_S0020_G0130_001_andman=But still...
M5500_S0020_G0140_001_andwoman=Ugh, honestly, you're always like this. Just be quiet for a second.
M5500_S0020_G0150_001_andwoman=See, we're thinking of escaping to another area across the sea.
M5500_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=I see... But how?
M5500_S0020_G0170_001_andwoman=There's an underground Resistance member who smuggles people out. They call him the "Escape Artist."
M5500_S0020_G0180_001_andwoman=But it costs quite a bit of money...
M5500_S0020_G0190_001_andwoman=To be blunt, we need about 50,000G. If you have it, would you mind helping us out?
M5500_S0020_G0200_001_sele=Give 50,000 G.
M5500_S0020_G0210_001_sele=Do not give.
M5500_S0020_G0220_001_andwoman=R-Really?! Are you sure!? Thank you!
M5500_S0020_G0230_001_andman=I'm sorry. This is all because I'm so useless...
M5500_S0020_G0240_001_andman=I promise, I'll pay you back someday.
M5500_S0020_G0250_001_andwoman=We need about 50,000 G to escape across the sea. If you have it, would you mind helping us out?
M5500_S0020_G0251_001_andwoman=Oh, it seems you don't have enough on hand right now.
M5500_S0020_G0252_001_andwoman=When you have it ready, will you come back?
M5500_S0020_G0260_001_andman=Ugh... ah...
M5500_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=Are you okay?! What in the world happened here?!
M5500_S0020_G0280_001_andman=T-The Escape Artist... he suddenly attacked us...!
M5500_S0020_G0290_001_andman=He was planning to betray us from the very beginning.
M5500_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=What happened to the other one?!
M5500_S0020_G0310_001_andman=Sh-She... acted as a decoy to protect me and drew them away...
M5500_S0020_G0320_001_andman=Please, will you help me find her?!
M5500_S0020_G0330_001_sele=Help.
M5500_S0020_G0340_001_sele=Do not help.
M5500_S0020_G0350_001_andman=Thank you... I'll give you her biological code. Please, I'm begging you!
M5500_S0020_G0370_001_a2b=Pod. Search for the location of the android with this biological code.
M5500_S0020_G0380_001_pod042=Details are unknown. However, information regarding the last sighted location exists.
M5500_S0020_G0390_001_pod042=As a result of comprehensive analysis, the android's current position is predicted to be within the Amusement Park Ruins area.
M5500_S0020_G0400_001_a2b=Understood.
M5500_S0020_G0410_001_a9s=Pod. Search for the location of the android with this biological code.
M5500_S0020_G0420_001_pod153=Details are unknown. However, information regarding the last sighted location exists.
M5500_S0020_G0430_001_pod153=As a result of comprehensive analysis, the android's current position is predicted to be within the Amusement Park Ruins area.
M5500_S0020_G0440_001_a9s=Understood.
M5500_S0060_G0000_001_andwoman=Ugh...
M5500_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=Are you okay?!
M5500_S0060_G0020_001_andwoman=Ugh, uuu...
M5500_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=She's taken a lot of damage. But these wounds aren't beyond repair.
M5500_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Please wait here for a bit. I'll gather the materials and come right back!
M5500_S0060_G0070_001_pod042="Shape Memory Alloy" is required to repair this android.
M5500_S0060_G0080_001_pod153="Shape Memory Alloy" is required to repair this android.
M5500_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=Pascal?! Why are you here?
M5500_S0060_G0100_001_pascal=I was worried about the two androids who were in my village, so I've been searching for them.
M5500_S0060_G0110_001_pascal=Just now, this one's signal suddenly became very weak, so...
M5500_S0060_G0120_001_pascal=Are those repair materials? Please, let me have them. I will fix her.
M5500_S0060_G0130_001_a9s=Got it!
M5500_S0060_G0140_001_pascal=............
M5500_S0060_G0150_001_a9s=What is it?
M5500_S0060_G0160_001_pascal=Well, the android is female, so if you could just close your eyes for a moment...
M5500_S0060_G0170_001_a9s=Whoa! I'm sorry! Right! Closing them! I'm closing my eyes right now!
M5500_S0060_G0180_001_pascal=This goes... like this... and like that...
M5500_S0060_G0190_001_pascal=There! It is done!
M5500_S0060_G0200_001_pascal=...Phew. She should be fine now.
M5500_S0060_G0210_001_andwoman=Thank you for saving me. By the way, is he okay?
M5500_S0060_G0220_001_a9s=Yes, he's safe. You can rest ea—
M5500_S0060_G0230_001_andman=Thank goodness, you're safe!
M5500_S0060_G0240_001_andwoman=Ah...!
M5500_S0060_G0250_001_andman=I'm sorry... if only I were stronger...!
M5500_S0060_G0260_001_andwoman=No, it's fine. As long as you're safe, I'm...
M5500_S0060_G0270_001_andman=We caused you a lot of trouble. I'm truly sorry.
M5500_S0060_G0280_001_pascal=Not at all. More importantly, what will you do now?
M5500_S0060_G0290_001_andman=...For now, we have to find a safe place.
M5500_S0060_G0300_001_andwoman=We're going to wander around again? Hunted by our former comrades, terrified of Machine Lifeforms...
M5500_S0060_G0310_001_andwoman=I can't stand that anymore!
M5500_S0060_G0320_001_andman=But...
M5500_S0060_G0330_001_andwoman=...Hey... If it's come to this, let's just go back to the Resistance Camp.
M5500_S0060_G0340_001_andwoman=If we initialize our memories and get a clean slate, I'm sure even Anemone-san will take us back...
M5500_S0060_G0350_001_andman=But, if we initialize... then these feelings I have for you...
M5500_S0060_G0360_001_andwoman=If we stay together like this, I'll just end up hating you.
M5500_S0060_G0370_001_andwoman=I'm sure that even if I'm initialized, I'll fall in love with you all over again.
M5500_S0060_G0380_001_andman=...Alright.
M5500_S0060_G0390_001_andwoman=Please. Erase our memories! And take us to the Resistance Camp!
M5500_S0060_G0400_001_sele=Cooperate.
M5500_S0060_G0410_001_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5500_S0060_G0420_001_andwoman=Please... erase our memories.
M5500_S0060_G0430_001_andman=...Thank you. In that case, start with me.
M5500_S0060_G0435_001_pascal=To go as far as erasing your memories... You two must be very close.
M5500_S0060_G0440_001_a9s=Understood...
M5500_S0060_G0450_001_a9s=...Format complete. He'll reboot in a little while.
M5500_S0060_G0460_001_a9s=Next is... you, right?
M5500_S0060_G0470_001_andwoman=Oh, I'm fine.
M5500_S0060_G0480_001_a9s=...Huh?
M5500_S0060_G0490_001_andwoman=...Looks like the format went well. As expected of the latest YoRHa model.
M5500_S0060_G0500_001_a9s=W-Wait a minute. What on earth are you—
M5500_S0060_G0510_001_andwoman=Well, we're just too weak, aren't we?
M5500_S0060_G0520_001_andwoman=So I thought, why not modify one of us into a combat type? That way, we won't need to run away.
M5500_S0060_G0530_001_andwoman=But we needed to initialize him for that. That's why I only had you format him.
M5500_S0060_G0540_001_andwoman=Well now, from here on I'll have to make him strong. Oh, and while I'm at it, maybe I'll change his pathetic personality a little. I prefer someone a bit more forceful, you see.
M5500_S0060_G0550_001_a9s=...
M5500_S0060_G0560_001_andwoman=Don't let it get to you. After all, this is the sixth time I've formatted him.
M5500_S0060_G0570_001_andwoman=You've been a huge help. I don't know if this counts as thanks, but...
M5500_S0060_G0580_001_andwoman=Well then, I'll be going now. The next time you see him, he'll be amazing!
M5500_S0060_G0590_001_pascal=Um, in other words, what does this mean?
M5500_S0060_G0600_001_a9s=...Women are terrifying.
M5500_S0060_G0610_001_pascal=Women are terrifying... I will remember that.
