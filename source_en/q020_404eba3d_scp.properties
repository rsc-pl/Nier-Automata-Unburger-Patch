M5020_S0010_G0000_001_sarutoru=Existence precedes essence...
M5020_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Um, excuse me.
M5020_S0010_G0020_001_sarutoru=A person can be nothing other than what they make of themselves, and also...
M5020_S0010_G0020_300_n02=The Machine Lifeform with the heavy face paint is on the first floor of the village.
M5020_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=He-llooo!
M5020_S0010_G0030_300_n02=Did you learn a little about Sartre?
M5020_S0010_G0040_001_sarutoru=...What is it? Who are you people?
M5020_S0010_G0050_001_sarutoru=Ah, I see. You also wish to attend my lecture, do you not?
M5020_S0010_G0060_001_sarutoru=Then let us first speak of Existentialism.
M5020_S0010_G0070_001_sarutoru=Are you listening? Essential existence is that which opposes actual existence...
M5020_S0010_G0080_001_sarutoru=To begin with, actual existence is...
M5020_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=This guy... he's hopeless.
M5020_S0010_G0100_001_n02=Ah... It's no use talking to Sartre.
M5020_S0010_G0110_001_n02=He only ever talks about difficult things like "Philosophy."
M5020_S0010_G0120_001_n02=If you want to know about him, you should probably try asking one of his fans.
M5020_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=...Fans?
M5020_S0010_G0140_001_n02=Strangely enough, Sartre has fans in various places.
M5020_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Though I have no idea why he's so popular.
M5020_S0010_G0160_001_n02=There's one in this village, too...
M5020_S0010_G0170_001_n02=The Machine Lifeform with the heavy paint on her face is the one.
M5020_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Hello... I have something I'd like to ask you.
M5020_S0020_G0000_300_sarutoru=Oh my, have you also come to attend my lecture?
M5020_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Do you know a robot named Sartre?
M5020_S0020_G0010_300_a9s=No, we're fine.
M5020_S0020_G0020_001_robogirl=Of course! Sartre-san knows everything and is so reliable.
M5020_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Reliable...? That guy?
M5020_S0020_G0040_001_robogirl=There's a lot I don't know, so I wrote him a letter. Please give it to him for me!
M5020_S0020_G0040_300_robogirl=Did you deliver the letter?
M5020_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=H-huh?
M5020_S0020_G0050_300_robogirl=Were you able to deliver the present?
M5020_S0020_G0060_001_robogirl=I'm not going to lose to the women in the Desert and the Amusement Park...!
M5020_S0020_G0060_300_robogirl=Did you give him the gift?
M5020_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=There are more of them...?
M5020_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=More importantly, they have genders...? These things.
M5020_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Um...
M5020_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Do you know a robot named Sartre who's in Pascal's Village...?
M5020_S0020_G0110_001_robogirl=Sartre-sama is a very mysterious and enigmatic person.\nAnd he is ever so cool.
M5020_S0020_G0120_001_a2b=Mysterious...? Cool...?
M5020_S0020_G0130_001_robogirl=I have prepared a present that's just perfect for someone like him.
M5020_S0020_G0140_001_robogirl=Please, deliver it for me.
M5020_S0020_G0150_001_robogirl=I won't let THAT woman in the Desert... get in the way of my love!
M5020_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Excuse me~!
M5020_S0020_G0170_001_robogirl=Ah!
M5020_S0020_G0180_001_a9s=Huh?
M5020_S0020_G0190_001_robogirl=You two, you came from Sartre-sama's village, didn't you...
M5020_S0020_G0200_001_robogirl=I can tell... I can tell by your scent...
M5020_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=This is kind of creepy...
M5020_S0020_G0220_001_robogirl=That man has a great spirit of inquiry; he's passionate and wonderful. He's my idol.
M5020_S0020_G0230_001_a2b=...That guy is?
M5020_S0020_G0240_001_robogirl=You've got no eye for this, do you? You seem like the type to get tricked by a man.
M5020_S0020_G0250_001_a2b=...
M5020_S0020_G0260_001_robogirl=Oh, that's right.
M5020_S0020_G0270_001_robogirl=I found something that might interest Sartre-sama. Take it to him!
M5020_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=...2B, I've been thinking about something.
M5020_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=What is it?
M5020_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Sartre-san... he's being pretty glorified, isn't he?
M5020_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=He certainly is... quite a bit...
M5020_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Um, excuse me.
M5020_S0040_G0010_001_sarutoru=I see, so it is.
M5020_S0040_G0020_001_sarutoru=A dream is a perfect realization within a closed, imaginary world, and...
M5020_S0040_G0030_001_a9s=Sartre. We're holding on to a present for you...
M5020_S0040_G0040_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0050_001_sarutoru=...Hmph. A letter, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0060_001_a2b=The female robot who gave this to us...
M5020_S0040_G0070_001_a2b=said that you know everything and are reliable.
M5020_S0040_G0080_001_sarutoru=Hmph. By the way, do you two not think that existence precedes essence?
M5020_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Um, what about a reply to the letter?
M5020_S0040_G0100_001_sarutoru=I will not be writing one. Why should I?
M5020_S0040_G0110_001_a9s=Wasn't there a question written in the letter...?
M5020_S0040_G0120_001_sarutoru=Is one obligated to answer any and all questions?
M5020_S0040_G0130_001_sarutoru=Who decided upon that obligation?
M5020_S0040_G0140_001_a2b=...Any more talking is pointless.
M5020_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=...Agreed.
M5020_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=Sartre, got a second?
M5020_S0040_G0170_001_sarutoru=Time that passes is, in other words, lost time.
M5020_S0040_G0180_001_sarutoru=It is an indolent and utterly lethargic—
M5020_S0040_G0185_001_a9s=Also, there's another present...
M5020_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=We're holding on to a present for Sartre.
M5020_S0040_G0200_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=Uh... it's this.
M5020_S0040_G0220_001_sarutoru=...Hmph, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0230_001_a2b=The female robot who gave us this said you were mysterious and cool.
M5020_S0040_G0240_001_sarutoru=Hmph. It is mere glass. Nothing more. In other words, this is—
M5020_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Um, do you have anything to say to the woman who gave you this...?
M5020_S0040_G0260_001_sarutoru=I do not. Nothing at all. It is, after all, simply glass.
M5020_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=Haaah...
M5020_S0040_G0280_001_a2b=...Let's go, 9S.
M5020_S0040_G0290_001_sarutoru=There is no longer a need for anything at all. This place, this village, and even I—
M5020_S0040_G0295_001_a2b=Also, we've been entrusted with one more present.
M5020_S0040_G0300_001_a2b=We have a present addressed to you.
M5020_S0040_G0310_001_sarutoru=Hmm, if that is the case, I shall listen.
M5020_S0040_G0320_001_a9s=Let's see... this fossil.
M5020_S0040_G0330_001_sarutoru=...Hmph, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0340_001_a2b=The female robot who gave us this said you have a great spirit of inquiry and are passionate.
M5020_S0040_G0350_001_sarutoru=A mechanical fossil? It serves no purpose whatsoever.
M5020_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Um, do you have anything to say to the woman who gave this...?
M5020_S0040_G0370_001_sarutoru=I do not. Nothing at all. It is, after all, useless junk.
M5020_S0040_G0380_001_a9s=Junk...
M5020_S0040_G0390_001_a2b=...
M5020_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Sartre paid absolutely no attention to the presents, did he?
M5020_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=...They might be waiting for a reply, so...
M5020_S0050_G0020_001_a9s=should we at least tell his fans what he said?
M5020_S0060_G0000_001_robogirl=Ah, you're finally here! What did Sartre-san say in his reply?
M5020_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=About that... he just said he's under no obligation to reply.
M5020_S0060_G0020_001_robogirl=OF COURSE!! That cool side of Sartre-san is the best!
M5020_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=It's the best, huh...
M5020_S0060_G0040_001_robogirl=You gave the present to Sartre-sama, yes?
M5020_S0060_G0050_001_robogirl=So, what was his reply?
M5020_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Uh... he said it was "just simple glass."
M5020_S0060_G0070_001_robogirl=Oh my!! Such words that strike at the very truth of the matter!
M5020_S0060_G0080_001_robogirl=I will follow you for all my life! Sartre-sama!
M5020_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=All her life, huh...
M5020_S0060_G0100_001_robogirl=Hey! Did Sartre-sama say anything about my present?
M5020_S0060_G0110_001_a9s=Well... he said it was "useless junk."
M5020_S0060_G0120_001_robogirl=Aaaah... what sadistic play!
M5020_S0060_G0130_001_robogirl=It sends shivers down my spine!
M5020_S0060_G0140_001_a9s=...
M5020_S0070_G0000_001_a9s=I'm feeling kind of drained...
M5020_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=Sartre doesn't think about others at all...
M5020_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=and his fans just project their own fantasies onto him and believe blindly...
M5020_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=What on earth is the meaning of this relationship?
M5020_S0070_G0040_001_a2b=...You should ask Sartre.
M5020_S0070_G0050_001_a9s=...Huh? Where'd Sartre go?
M5020_S0070_G0060_001_n02=Oh, it's you two.
M5020_S0070_G0070_001_n02=If you're looking for Sartre, he's not here anymore.
M5020_S0070_G0070_300_robogirl=I have to write a new letter to Sartre-san.\nI won't lose to the other women!
M5020_S0070_G0080_001_n02=He left on a journey.
M5020_S0070_G0080_300_robogirl=Haaah... Sartre-sama...\nWhat do I have to do to make you look my way...
M5020_S0070_G0090_001_a9s=A journey?
M5020_S0070_G0090_300_robogirl=You... seem close to Sartre-sama, but don't think I'll let you get a head start...
M5020_S0070_G0100_001_n02=Yeah... something about going to find himself.
M5020_S0070_G0110_001_n02=I'm holding a letter for you two, so here you go.
M5020_S0070_G0120_001_a9s=He was incomprehensible right to the very end...
M5020_S0070_G0130_001_a9s=I wonder if men and women among humanity also had such strange relationships.
M5020_S0070_G0140_001_a2b=...Who knows.
