M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=STOP! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=WE WON'T FIGHT! WE WON'T FIGHT!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=DON'T KILL US! DON'T KILL US!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We didn't do anything wrong...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=WE'RE SORRY! WE'RE SORRY!
M3060_S0036_G0050_001_a9s=......
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=...They said my little sister was found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=To think she would stop moving before I did...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5221_S0030_G0130_001_robochild=Thank you!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such precious information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is a small token of my gratitude. Please, accept it.
M5802_S0010_G0230_001_robomother=Ah... My, when did he learn to say such admirable things...?
M5802_S0010_G0240_001_robomother=This is all thanks to you. Thank you so much!
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Oh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is just as Sartre-san says.
M6050_S0010_G1840_300_villager=Hello. \nIt seems there's nothing out of the ordinary in the village today either.
M6050_S0010_G1850_300_villager=Please, stay and relax for as long as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1860_300_villager=There's nothing here, but having nothing is what makes it special.
M6050_S0010_G1870_300_villager=Taking a slow walk around is a nice change of pace, you know.
M6050_S0010_G1880_300_kj=See anythin' you're interested in?
M6050_S0010_G1890_300_kj=I've got a promise to meet with the fella in the forest soon.
M6050_S0010_G1900_300_kj=He's the one who taught me craftsmanship, so I can guarantee his skill.
M6050_S0010_G1910_300_kj=Come show your face again.
M6050_S0010_G1920_300_ps=Look around as much as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1930_300_ps=Come again.
M6050_S0010_G1950_300_villager=...I woke up, and one of my torsos was gone again.
M6050_S0010_G1960_300_villager=I heard that other guy found one and got bigger, so I guess I have to go searching again too.
M6050_S0010_G1970_300_villager=Looking for parts ain't easy, you know.
M6050_S0010_G1980_300_villager=Look, look! I got another torso!
M6050_S0010_G1990_300_villager=I found the parts outside the village.
M6050_S0010_G2000_300_villager=I-It's true!
M6050_S0010_G2010_300_villager=Just one more and I can have the three-tiered belly of my dreams.
M6050_S0010_G2020_300_villager=I haven't seen the forest animals lately.
M6050_S0010_G2030_300_villager=I hope they're all doing well.
M6050_S0010_G2040_300_villager=You smell like me right now.
M6050_S0010_G2050_300_villager=And I don't mean the smell of machine oil.
M6050_S0010_G2060_300_villager=You're an odd one for coming to my place.
M6050_S0010_G2070_300_villager=There's nothing interesting here, but I can talk, if that's all you want.
M6050_S0010_G2080_300_pascal=I observed a large explosion far up in the sky.
M6050_S0010_G2090_300_pascal=I thought it might be, but... was it a place connected to you?
M6050_S0010_G2100_300_pascal=I do not think this village can serve as a replacement, but we will always welcome you.
M6050_S0010_G2110_300_pascal=Please think of it as your own village and take your time.
M6050_S0010_G2120_300_villager=You been well?
M6050_S0010_G2130_300_villager=I've been more well!
M6050_S0010_G2140_300_villager=Wanna play with us?
M6050_S0010_G2150_300_villager=Uncle Pascal said being energetic is the most important thing!
M6050_S0010_G2160_300_villager=Wanna play with us and get energetic too?
M6050_S0010_G2170_300_villager=They insisted, so I decided to play with them too.
M6050_S0010_G2180_300_villager=Honestly, what a helpless bunch.
M6050_S0010_G2190_300_villager=So, what are we playing today? Tag? Hide-and-seek? Either's fine with me.
M6050_S0010_G2240_300_villager=I've gotten tired of the view from up here.
M6050_S0010_G2250_300_villager=I'm thinking of going for a walk for the first time in a while.
M6050_S0010_G2260_300_villager=When you're flying all the time, sometimes you just want a change of pace, don't you think?
M6050_S0010_G2270_300_villager=I am thinking of establishing a residence soon.
M6050_S0010_G2280_300_villager=I saw the sky flash with light!
M6050_S0010_G2290_300_villager=Could that be what the rumors call a shooting star?! Gotta make a wish!
M6050_S0010_G2300_300_villager=...I wish that I can live happily with everyone in the village forever.
M6050_S0010_G2420_300_villager=I still haven't played enough!
M6050_S0010_G2430_300_villager=What's next? What'll we play?
M6050_S0010_G2440_300_villager=Let's play that game where the Daruma-san falls down!
M6050_S0010_G2450_300_villager=Even though I have a big body, there are still things I can do, right?
M6050_S0010_G2460_300_villager=When the time comes... I'll fight for everyone.
M6050_S0010_G2470_300_villager=Looking up all the time has made my neck tired.
M6050_S0010_G2480_300_villager=...I wonder where my neck is.
M6050_S0010_G2490_300_villager=This world is too small for me...
M6050_S0010_G2500_300_villager=...My neck is getting tired.
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible!
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Another fine day, isn't it?
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you need anything, please let me know.
M6050_S0010_G3100_300_villager=Getting carried around was so fun, it seems I asked a bit too much. I don't have arms, so I couldn't tell.
M6050_S0010_G3110_300_villager=We made up, but I wonder if he'll carry me more often if I give him oil for his arms...
M6050_S0010_G3120_300_villager=Playing alone just isn't fun after all.
M6050_S0010_G3130_300_villager=So I decided to make up with him. But, he's only allowed to carry me to three places a day.
