M5640_S0010_G0010_001_resistance=...Right.
M5640_S0010_G0020_001_resistance=Sorry to spring this on you, but could you help me out? It's an emergency.
M5640_S0010_G0030_001_resistance=It seems a few plug-in chips with classified information were stolen by Machine Lifeforms.
M5640_S0010_G0040_001_resistance=It'll be a problem if the enemy misuses those chips. I want to get them back somehow. Please, lend me a hand!
M5640_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Lend a hand.
M5640_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Refuse.
M5640_S0010_G0070_001_resistance=You could at least help... You're a cold one.
M5640_S0010_G0080_001_resistance=I need to get those plug-in chips with the classified intel back from the machines, no matter what. Please, lend me a hand!
M5640_S0010_G0090_001_resistance=Thanks! There are three stolen plug-in chips.
M5640_S0010_G0100_001_resistance=I'll give you the chips' signal codes.
M5640_S0010_G0110_001_resistance=They're still somewhere in this city. Find them and bring them back!
M5640_S0010_G0120_001_resistance=Please, find the stolen plug-in chips!

M5640_S0050_G0000_001_resistance=Ah, you saved me. Thank you! Now, hand over the plug-in chips.
M5640_S0050_G0010_001_sele=Hand over plug-in chips.
M5640_S0050_G0020_001_sele=Do not hand over plug-in chips.
M5640_S0050_G0030_001_resistance=Why...?!
M5640_S0050_G0040_001_resistance=Are you suspecting something?!
M5640_S0050_G0050_001_resistance=Hey, come on... I need those!
M5640_S0050_G0060_001_resistance=Thank you. This is all I can give you as thanks, but...
M5640_S0050_G0070_001_resistance=I can trust you guys. Next time we meet... I'll introduce you to my family. See ya.
M5640_S0050_G0080_001_resistance=You got the plug-in chips back for me. You really saved me back then.
M5640_S0050_G0090_001_resistance=...You knew, didn't you? That they belonged to a YoRHa unit.
M5640_S0050_G0100_001_resistance=Allow me to introduce you. This is my family.
M5640_S0050_G0110_001_a2b=Family?
M5640_S0050_G0120_001_a9s=Family?
M5640_S0050_G0130_001_resistance=...I've always wondered what it was like to have a family.
M5640_S0050_G0140_001_resistance=Seeing the Machine Lifeforms living so close together made me feel even more lonely...
M5640_S0050_G0150_001_resistance=So I... stole the broken body of a YoRHa unit.
M5640_S0050_G0160_001_resistance=I thought I could repair her, and she could become my family.
M5640_S0050_G0170_001_ys=He... Hel-lo...
M5640_S0050_G0180_001_a2b=This is...
M5640_S0050_G0190_001_a9s=This is a clear violation of regulations.
M5640_S0050_G0200_001_resistance=I know what I did was wrong. But I... I wanted to try living while protecting someone, while being close to someone.
M5640_S0050_G0210_001_resistance=I trust you. So please, keep this between us.
M5640_S0050_G0220_001_yolhaS=Plea... se.

M5640_S0050_G0380_001_a2b=Really?
M5640_S0050_G0390_001_a9s=Really?
M5640_S0050_G0400_001_resistance=...Forget about the plug-in chips.
M5640_S0050_G0410_001_resistance=See ya.
M5640_S0050_G0420_001_resistance=What is it? Did you change your mind about handing over the plug-in chips?
