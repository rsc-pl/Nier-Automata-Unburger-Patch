M5160_S0000_G0000_300_cmd=Deliver the necessary materials to the Resistance Leader.
M5160_S0010_G0000_001_cmd=Ah, come to think of it, there is a job I want to request.
M5160_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=I want you to perform improvements on the communication environment between the surface and here.
M5160_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=This is to plan for more efficient operation deployment.
M5160_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=First, I want you to deliver necessary materials to the leader of the Resistance Camp.
M5160_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=The method of obtaining materials will be conveyed via the Operator after descent to the surface.
M5160_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Roger.
M5160_S0020_G0000_001_op60=From Operator to 2B-san.
M5160_S0020_G0010_001_op60=Please collect the necessary materials for communication environment improvement.
M5160_S0020_G0020_001_op60=The necessary materials are "Rusty Bolt", "Small Gear", and "Spring".
M5160_S0020_G0021_001_op60=It seems materials can be obtained from small enemies in some cases.
M5160_S0020_G0030_001_op60=Once the materials are gathered, please hand them to the Resistance Camp leader, Anemone-san.
M5160_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=Roger.
M5160_S0020_G0050_001_op60=It's a little tough, but please do your best, 2B-san!
M5160_S0020_G0060_001_op210=From Operator to 9S.
M5160_S0020_G0070_001_op60=I will convey the necessary materials for communication environment improvement.
M5160_S0020_G0080_001_op60=The necessary materials are "Rusty Bolt", "Small Gear", and "Spring".
M5160_S0020_G0081_001_op60=It seems materials can be obtained from small enemies in some cases.
M5160_S0020_G0090_001_op60=Once the materials are gathered, hand the materials to Resistance Camp Leader Anemone.
M5160_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Roger thaaat.
M5160_S0020_G0110_001_op210=There is no need to extend the end of your sentence. Over.
M5160_S0030_G0000_001_op60=From Operator 6O to 2B-san.
M5160_S0030_G0010_001_op60=It seems all materials necessary for communication environment improvement have been obtained.
M5160_S0030_G0020_001_op60=Please hand the collected materials to Anemone-san. That ends the mission.
M5160_S0030_G0030_001_op210=From Operator 21O to 9S.
M5160_S0030_G0040_001_op60=I have confirmed that the materials necessary for communication environment improvement are assembled.
M5160_S0030_G0050_001_op60=Please hand the collected materials to the Resistance Leader. Over.
M5160_S0040_G0000_001_ane=I've received contact from the Bunker.
M5160_S0040_G0010_001_ane=It's the materials necessary for communication environment maintenance. I have certainly received them.
M5160_S0040_G0020_001_ane=This is small, but it's a reward. \nIt's probably a violation of regulations, so keep it a secret from the Commander.
M5160_S0040_G0030_001_a2b=From 2B to Operator 6O. Material handover complete.
M5160_S0040_G0040_001_op60=Roger. Good work!
M5160_S0040_G0050_001_a9s=...Good grief, as usual the Commander drives people hard, doesn't she.
M5160_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=She's strict about rules too, she probably lives a life like an efficiency-priority robot.
M5160_S0040_G0070_001_op60=The Commander isn't that stiff, you know?
M5160_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Eh? What do you mean?
M5160_S0040_G0090_001_op60=The Commander, despite how she looks, is surprisingly sloppy/haphazard.
M5160_S0040_G0100_001_op60=When she takes off clothes she just leaves them there and lets them pile up, so the laundry team is often lamenting it.
M5160_S0040_G0110_001_op60=Also, she doesn't perform maintenance checks on her own body at all.
M5160_S0040_G0120_001_op60=Not showing those rough parts to people is very like the Commander though.
M5160_S0040_G0130_001_a2b=Why do you know that?
M5160_S0040_G0140_001_op60=Fufufu... It's a secret.
M5160_S0040_G0150_001_op60=Well then.
M5160_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=A secret...
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location information obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location information obtained. Marking on map.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How's your condition? \nDon't be too reckless.
