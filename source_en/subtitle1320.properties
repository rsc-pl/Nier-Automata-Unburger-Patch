M5096_S0010_H0000_001_telo=Deserving of Life
M5096_S0010_H0010_001_telo=I found someone I loved
M5096_S0010_H0020_001_telo=And our touch was real
M5096_S0010_H0030_001_telo=Soil over asphalt
M5096_S0010_H0040_001_telo=Skin over steel
M5096_S0010_H0050_001_telo=If what we choose without thinking
M5096_S0010_H0060_001_telo=Is warmth over coldness
M5096_S0010_H0070_001_telo=Then that dirty face of yours
M5096_S0010_H0080_001_telo=Is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0090_001_telo=Those who mocked us
M5096_S0010_H0100_001_telo=Saying we didn't know our place
M5096_S0010_H0110_001_telo=We will sing and sing
M5096_S0010_H0120_001_telo=Of how they didn't know their own
M5096_S0010_H0130_001_telo=If you need a reason
M5096_S0010_H0140_001_telo=To move forward
M5096_S0010_H0150_001_telo=Be it anger or anything else
M5096_S0010_H0160_001_telo=It is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0170_001_telo=To evaporate the tears I've spilled
M5096_S0010_H0180_001_telo=For the morning when the sun will shine
M5096_S0010_H0190_001_telo=Without tiring
M5096_S0010_H0200_001_telo=Without regret
M5096_S0010_H0210_001_telo=I am waiting
M5096_S0010_H0220_001_telo=I am waiting
M5096_S0010_H0230_001_telo=From the day I wasted it all
M5096_S0010_H0240_001_telo=I was watching and waiting for my chance to paint
M5096_S0010_H0250_001_telo=The morning where everything would be rewarded
M5096_S0010_H0260_001_telo=Worthy of destroying the world
M5096_S0010_H0270_001_telo=That warmth
M5096_S0010_H0280_001_telo=We couldn't become two
M5096_S0010_H0290_001_telo=Between one loneliness and another
M5096_S0010_H0300_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0310_001_telo=That habit of smiling when you're hurt
M5096_S0010_H0320_001_telo=There was never any reason to be so sad
M5096_S0010_H0330_001_telo=If only I never had a heart
M5096_S0010_H0340_001_telo=I made a friend
M5096_S0010_H0350_001_telo=We shared our ideals
M5096_S0010_H0360_001_telo=To the place we were meant to go
M5096_S0010_H0370_001_telo=We even walked in step
M5096_S0010_H0380_001_telo="It's fine if I'm betrayed"
M5096_S0010_H0390_001_telo=Like prostrating on the roadside
M5096_S0010_H0400_001_telo=The very dawn of that intoxication
M5096_S0010_H0410_001_telo=Is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0420_001_telo=I'm always just searching
M5096_S0010_H0430_001_telo=To replace something I've lost
M5096_S0010_H0440_001_telo=But it's not that
M5096_S0010_H0450_001_telo=I'm hoping for a comeback story
M5096_S0010_H0460_001_telo=One that lets me say even loss was the right answer
M5096_S0010_H0470_001_telo=And that is never impossible
M5096_S0010_H0480_001_telo=Even the footprints that vanished
M5096_S0010_H0490_001_telo=Call them a journey
M5096_S0010_H0500_001_telo=Worthy of deceiving the world
M5096_S0010_H0510_001_telo=Everything we were until now
M5096_S0010_H0520_001_telo=We couldn't be alone
M5096_S0010_H0530_001_telo=A gathering of lonely souls
M5096_S0010_H0540_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0550_001_telo=Putting on a face that says it's fine to be hurt
M5096_S0010_H0560_001_telo=There was never any reason to be so sad
M5096_S0010_H0570_001_telo=If only I never had a heart
M5096_S0010_H0580_001_telo=For the sake of protecting the things I loved
M5096_S0010_H0590_001_telo=The countless things I destroyed
M5096_S0010_H0600_001_telo=The countless wishes
M5096_S0010_H0610_001_telo=That were shattered all too easily
M5096_S0010_H0620_001_telo=Like crossing barefoot over those fragments
M5096_S0010_H0630_001_telo=Slipping and falling on the very next step
M5096_S0010_H0640_001_telo=The one step where you feel
M5096_S0010_H0650_001_telo=It's okay to die right there
M5096_S0010_H0660_001_telo=That, just that, is what's deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0670_001_telo=That loss
M5096_S0010_H0680_001_telo=Which was worth losing a heart for
M5096_S0010_H0690_001_telo=Joy and sadness
M5096_S0010_H0700_001_telo=Were never meant to be a trade-off
M5096_S0010_H0710_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0720_001_telo=The answer to that is who I am right now
M5096_S0010_H0730_001_telo=Something like hope
M5096_S0010_H0740_001_telo=Can be thrown away so very easily
M5096_S0010_H0750_001_telo=If only I never had a heart
M5096_S0010_H0760_001_telo=Light and Shadow
