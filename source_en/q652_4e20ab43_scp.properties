M5652_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, if you're looking for the Resistance member who was here, he's outside.
M5652_S0010_G0010_001_resiman=Something about going to hand over some cargo at the outpost near the desert...
M5652_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=But he's way overdue to come back.
M5652_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=If it's not too much trouble, could you check on him if you're heading that way?
M5652_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Go check on him.
M5652_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Refuse.
M5652_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=Hmph... I see. Let me know if you change your mind.
M5652_S0010_G0070_001_resiman=Hey, would you mind going to check on that guy who went to deliver cargo to the desert?
M5652_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=Thank you. That's a big help.
M5652_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=He should have gone to meet the Resistance woman in the desert. I'm counting on you.
M5652_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=He should have gone to the desert to hand over the cargo. I'm counting on you.
M5652_S0020_G0000_001_jackas=Huh? The guy who brought the cargo? ...Yeah, he was here.
M5652_S0020_G0010_001_jackas=The cargo was a broken water purifier, but I've already finished the repairs and delivered it.
M5652_S0020_G0020_001_jackas=I took it to the storage area with him... He's not back yet?
M5652_S0020_G0030_001_jackas=We keep everything in one place in the City Ruins so the enemy can't get to it.
M5652_S0020_G0040_001_jackas=He should be around there, don't you think? I'll show you the location.
M5652_S0020_G0050_001_jackas=He should be at the storage area in the main City Ruins.
M5652_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=So these are the materials the Resistance is storing...
M5652_S0020_G0070_001_resiman=...me...
M5652_S0020_G0080_001_resiman=...p me... help meeee...
M5652_S0020_G0090_001_pod153=Acoustic effect believed to originate from vocal cords confirmed within the cargo pile.
M5652_S0020_G0100_001_a2=So this is the material the Resistance is storing...
M5652_S0020_G0110_001_resiman=...me...
M5652_S0020_G0120_001_resiman=...p me... help meeee...
M5652_S0020_G0130_001_pod042=Acoustic effect believed to originate from vocal cords confirmed within the cargo pile.
M5652_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=S-Saved... Thank you...
M5652_S0030_G0001_001_resiman=This is a lot to ask, but could you clear a path for me to the exit?
M5652_S0030_G0002_001_resiman=I hurt my leg trying to force my way out...
M5652_S0030_G0003_001_resiman=And as you can see, I'm a pretty big guy... so please make it wide.
M5652_S0030_G0010_001_resiman=The truth is, I got trapped while I was organizing the cargo...
M5652_S0030_G0020_001_resiman=My senpai who came with me was throwing the cargo around so carelessly, I got caught up in it.
M5652_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=I can't work with that senpai anym—
M5652_S0030_G0040_001_jackas=HEYYYYYYYYY!!
M5652_S0030_G0050_001_jackas=I was wondering where you'd gone off to! What are you slacking off for?!
M5652_S0030_G0060_001_jackas=I'm pretty sure I taught you the know-how of materials management!
M5652_S0030_G0070_001_resiman=You can talk about know-how all you want, but I was trapped because you were throwing the cargo around!
M5652_S0030_G0080_001_jackas=You could've just blown it up with a bomb, couldn't you?!
M5652_S0030_G0090_001_resiman=I don't have a bomb...
M5652_S0030_G0100_001_jackas=You can make a bomb in a flash with the materials around here. It's the most basic of basics!
M5652_S0030_G0110_001_resiman=There's no way...
M5652_S0030_G0120_001_jackas=There's no "no way" about it! We're starting over from the basics of bomb-making, right now!
M5652_S0030_G0130_001_resiman=Whaaat?! I'm in charge of materials management, not... violent stuff...
M5652_S0030_G0140_001_jackas=Ha ha! A materials manager must be an expert who can break through any situation!
M5652_S0030_G0150_001_jackas=Sorry. My useless junior caused you a lot of trouble.
M5652_S0030_G0160_001_jackas=Here, this is an apology. Take it.
M5652_S0030_G0170_001_jackas=Well then... take care.
M5652_S0030_G0180_001_jackas=I've got to pull an all-nighter teaching this one how to make bombs.
M5652_S0030_G0190_001_resiman=Whaaaat?! No way!
