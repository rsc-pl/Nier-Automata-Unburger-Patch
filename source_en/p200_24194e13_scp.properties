M1050_S0115_S0000_201_eve=Hey... Nii-chan. Why do you read books?
M1050_S0115_S0010_201_adam=Because knowledge enriches a person.
M1050_S0115_S0020_201_eve=Wouldn't it be enough to just transfer it via data?
M1050_S0115_S0030_201_adam=If you don't read it yourself, it won't enter your heart.
M1050_S0115_S0040_201_eve=...Okay.
M1050_S0115_S0050_201_eve=...
M1050_S0115_S0060_201_eve=...Hey, Nii-chan.
M1050_S0115_S0070_201_adam=What is it?
M1050_S0115_S0080_201_eve=My name, Eve, it's written here that it's a woman's name.
M1050_S0115_S0090_201_eve=Wouldn't something like "Cain and Abel" be better for our names?
M1050_S0115_S0100_201_adam=Humans do not easily change their names.
M1050_S0115_S0110_201_adam=Have pride in your own name... Eve.
M1050_S0115_S0120_201_eve=...Okay.
M1050_S0115_S0130_201_eve=If you say so, Brother, I'm fine with Eve.
M1050_S0115_S0140_201_adam=Good boy.
M1050_S0115_S0150_201_eve=...Hey, Nii-chan.
M1050_S0115_S0160_201_adam=What is it?
M1050_S0115_S0170_201_eve=When I finish reading this, let's go play.
M1050_S0115_S0180_201_eve=I think it'll be super fun, for sure.
M1050_S0115_S0190_201_adam=...I don't mind. But, only after you read the book.
M1050_S0115_S0200_201_eve=Really!?
M1050_S0115_S0210_201_eve=Then, I'll do my best to read it!
M1050_S0115_S0220_201_eve=I'll work hard and read it!
M1050_S0115_S0230_201_adam=Yeah... Do that.
