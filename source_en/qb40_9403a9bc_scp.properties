M6010_S0010_G0640_300_ys=...Things are fine on this end. Yeah, no sign that they've noticed...
M6010_S0010_G0650_300_ys=What do you want? Go away.
M6010_S0010_G0660_300_ys=Hey, you're being a pest. What communication? That's none of your business.
M6010_S0010_G0670_300_ys=...Yeah, it's a problem over here. Don't worry about it.
M6010_S0010_G0680_300_ys=C'mon, get going. Shoo.
M6010_S0010_G0690_300_ys=...Operator briefings are too detailed. As long as I have the necessary data on-site, I can handle the rest myself.
M6010_S0010_G0700_300_ys=My partner seems awfully nervous... Do I really look that unreliable?
M6010_S0010_G0710_300_ys=The operator-san is explaining everything so carefully, but I can't understand any of it... I'm worried I'll just drag my senior down...
M6010_S0010_G0720_300_ys=...Um, excuse me... I don't quite understand the explanation... Could you please repeat it...?
M6010_S0010_G0730_300_op=...That is the mission overview. Next are the details...
M6010_S0010_G0740_300_op=...Can I help you? I'm in the middle of a mission briefing, so please do not disturb me.
M6010_S0010_G0750_300_op=This one seems incredibly nervous, probably because she was only recently manufactured.
M6010_S0010_G0760_300_op=If you can't keep your reports short, concise, and to the point, you can't be called a proper operator.
M6010_S0010_G0770_300_op=Even if she messes up a bit, I'll cover for her. We're partners, after all... The same as you two, right?
M6010_S0010_G0780_300_ys=You don't have to worry so much. I have enough Recovery Medicine, and I can manage my own condition.
M6010_S0010_G0790_300_ys=...*Sigh*...
M6010_S0010_G0800_300_ys=I'm grateful for her concern, but... at this rate, I feel like I'll never get to deploy...
M6010_S0010_G0810_300_op=Are you really alright?
M6010_S0010_G0820_300_op=Did you bring your Recovery Medicine? Do you have enough? If your vitals drop, you'll treat yourself immediately, won't you?
M6010_S0010_G0830_300_op=*Sigh*... I'm so worried... Maybe I should put in a request to transfer to an Operator model...
M6010_S0010_G0940_300_ys=Listen up, you lot! The survival of humanity rests in our hands! Steel yourselves and carry out your mission!
M6010_S0010_G0950_300_ys=If you find a Machine Lifeform, show no mercy! We cannot forgive evil!
M6010_S0010_G0960_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0010_G0970_300_ys=My dream is to be like the captain, defeating countless Machine Lifeforms and contributing to humanity's victory.
M6010_S0010_G0980_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0010_G0990_300_ys=I'm not suited for combat, but I was assigned to a combat unit... I wonder if it's too late to change to an Operator...
M6010_S0010_G1000_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0010_G1010_300_ys=The captain is the type to get caught up in formalities. Instead of shouting orders here, I wish we could just get on with the mission...
M6010_S0010_G1020_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0010_G1030_300_op=She seems to have forgotten to actually explain the mission in her passionate speech. Will they be okay?
M6010_S0010_G1040_300_op=Well, I can just contact them once they reach the surface, so it doesn't really matter.
M6010_S0010_G1050_300_op=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G0640_300_ys=...Do you believe in this? Who is this war for?
M6010_S0020_G0650_300_ys=...It's nothing. I misspoke. Don't worry about it.
M6010_S0020_G0660_300_ys=It's useless to keep an eye on me.
M6010_S0020_G0670_300_ys=I'm not plotting a rebellion. Want to report me to Command?
M6010_S0020_G0680_300_ys=...Not that they'd listen, anyway.
M6010_S0020_G0690_300_ys=How's it going? As for us... we're getting by.
M6010_S0020_G0700_300_ys=She's a lot better than she was at the start, but she still has a long way to go. We need more training.
M6010_S0020_G0710_300_ys=I've started to get the hang of missions recently. I'm still just holding everyone back, but someday I'll...
M6010_S0020_G0720_300_ys=...Mission understood! I'll do my absolute best!
M6010_S0020_G0730_300_op=...That is the mission overview. I will contact you with the details later.
M6010_S0020_G0740_300_op=...What's with that look?
M6010_S0020_G0750_300_op=It seems she's gotten completely used to the job lately. I'm a little lonely.
M6010_S0020_G0760_300_op=You two are perfectly in sync as well. We can't afford to lose to you.
M6010_S0020_G0770_300_ys=When my comrades are fighting, I can't just pull back because it's "dangerous."
M6010_S0020_G0780_300_ys=My data is backed up, and any injuries can be fixed with repairs. ...Operators are such worrywarts.
M6010_S0020_G0790_300_ys=Combat units exist to fight.
M6010_S0020_G0800_300_ys=I want to contribute to humanity's victory alongside my comrades. I'm sure you feel the same, right?
M6010_S0020_G0810_300_op=Are you listening? You must not let your guard down, is that clear?
M6010_S0020_G0820_300_op=If you think it's dangerous, pull back immediately and let the other units handle it... Are you even listening to me?
M6010_S0020_G0830_300_op=...Last time, she just got lucky and came back unscathed... My heart sinks thinking she might get seriously injured next time...
M6010_S0020_G0840_300_op=Maybe I should model-change to a combat specialization...?
M6010_S0020_G0950_300_ys=You lot! You did well in the last operation! We will continue in this vein and reclaim glory for humanity!
M6010_S0020_G0960_300_ys=Justice cannot be allowed to lose. For the sake of our comrades who fell before us, we will be victorious.
M6010_S0020_G0970_300_ys=Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0020_G0980_300_ys=I want to contribute to humanity's victory, but I only ever hold everyone back... Next time... for sure...
M6010_S0020_G0990_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind!
M6010_S0020_G1000_300_ys=...I don't like seeing people die for the sake of "humanity," people I've never even met.
M6010_S0020_G1010_300_ys=I wish we could all just keep living here together... Why isn't that allowed?
M6010_S0020_G1020_300_ys=...Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G1030_300_ys=The captain always shields us whenever one of us is about to get hit.
M6010_S0020_G1040_300_ys=Every time she does, her data gets rewound. She barely has any memories of spending time with us, but she still does it. She's an idiot.
M6010_S0020_G1050_300_ys=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0020_G1060_300_op=If a peace treaty with the Machine Lifeforms is established, there won't be any more sacrifices, but some people just can't accept that.
M6010_S0020_G1070_300_op=Glory to Mankind.
M6010_S0080_G0340_300_op=<<Surface unit, this is the Bunker. Transferring data required for your next mission.>>
M6010_S0080_G0350_300_op=What are you doing here?
M6010_S0080_G0360_300_op=The combat units are still fighting on the surface. Get moving.
M6010_S0080_G0370_300_op=<<Surface unit, this is the Bunker.>>
M6010_S0080_G0380_300_op=<<Your vitals seem to be a little low. Don't push yourself, get some treatment.>>
M6010_S0080_G0390_300_op=...Oh, what are you doing here? Maybe I'll snatch up all the glory while you're resting.
M6010_S0080_G0400_300_op=<<Surface unit, this is the Bunker.>>
M6010_S0080_G0410_300_op=<<Are there any abnormalities?>>
M6010_S0080_G0415_300_op=<<Your vitals seem normal, but there might be an undetectable error. You should return for maintenance soon...>>
M6010_S0080_G0420_300_op=<<Ah, wait, don't hang up!>>
M6010_S0080_G0430_300_op=The comms won't connect... Did something happen...?
M6010_S0080_G0440_300_op=<<Hello, can you hear me? Hellooo!>>
M6010_S0080_G0510_300_op=<<Bunker to surface unit. Mission information has been updated. Transferring data now.>>
M6010_S0080_G0520_300_op=<<Follow the captain's orders, and whatever you do, don't overdo it!>>
M6010_S0080_G0530_300_op=Oh, you. Is your mission already over?
