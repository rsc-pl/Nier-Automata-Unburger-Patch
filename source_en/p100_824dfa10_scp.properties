M1030_S0010_G0111_001_op210=Operator to 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=Yes, this is 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0113_001_op210=There is a message from the Commander for both 2B and 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Playing now.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=We've lost contact with several YoRHa units en route to the surface.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=However, their black box signals are still being confirmed, so we presume they are not deceased.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We have narrowed down the point of origin for the signals.
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=All YoRHa units currently stationed on the surface are ordered to investigate this matter.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=That is all. Terminating communication.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Come to think of it... I heard something similar at the Resistance Camp...
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=I've set the coordinates for the target location.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=I think we should get there as soon as we can.
M1030_S0015_G0000_001_ane=Ah, it's you two.
M1030_S0015_G0010_001_ane=Jackass told me about the Machine Lifeforms in the desert. Sounds like you had a rough time.
M1030_S0015_G0020_001_ane=It's not much, but as thanks, I've prepared a room for you YoRHa folks.
M1030_S0015_G0030_001_a2b=A room?
M1030_S0015_G0040_001_ane=The YoRHa units have been a great help to us... Please, use it as you see fit.
M1030_S0015_G0050_001_a9s=Thank you very much!
