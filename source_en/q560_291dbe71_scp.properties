M5560_S0010_G0000_001_dbl=Oh, right. Hey, wanna help us out with our work for a bit?
M5560_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=Hey, Devola...
M5560_S0010_G0020_001_dbl=Can't be helped, can it? Ever since that damn huge "Tower" showed up, we're short on materials and manpower.
M5560_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=If we keep getting bogged down with chores, we can't even properly repair the Resistance members.
M5560_S0010_G0040_001_ppl=That's true, but...
M5560_S0010_G0050_001_dbl=So that's the deal. Please! Help us with our work.
M5560_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Help.
M5560_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Refuse.
M5560_S0010_G0080_001_dbl=Tch, stingy.
M5560_S0010_G0090_001_ppl=Devola... I'm sorry for asking the impossible. If you feel up to it later, please let us know.
M5560_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=So, feeling up to helping with our work now?
M5560_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=You're a lifesaver! Alright then, I need "Stripped Screws," "Small Gears," and "Machine Oil."
M5560_S0010_G0111_001_dbl=You should be able to get "Stripped Screws" from the piles of scrapped Machine Lifeforms.
M5560_S0010_G0112_001_dbl=I think "Small Gears" can be taken from the small, short-legged Machine Lifeforms.
M5560_S0010_G0113_001_ppl=I believe "Machine Oil" can be found near the scrapped truck in the Abandoned Factory.
M5560_S0010_G0120_001_ppl=Please don't push yourself.
M5560_S0010_G0130_001_dbl=By the way, how are those requested items coming along?
M5560_S0010_G0140_001_ppl=We could really use some "Stripped Screws," "Small Gears," and "Machine Oil."
M5560_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=We've got all the materials Devola and Popola asked for...
M5560_S0010_G0160_001_a2=Got the materials the red-haired twins asked for... Guess I'll go hand them over.
M5560_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=This is it! Thanks, you're a real help.
M5560_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=Alright Devola, let's get to work right away.
M5560_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=...What are you using those materials for, anyway?
M5560_S0030_G0030_001_a2=What are you two making?
M5560_S0030_G0040_001_dbl=Can't you tell by looking? Daily necessities for the camp.
M5560_S0030_G0050_001_ppl=Our work is mostly odd jobs...
M5560_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Odd jobs...? With your level of technical skill?
M5560_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Odd jobs? Even with your high level of technical skill?
M5560_S0030_G0080_001_ppl=...It's fine. This is our job.
M5560_S0030_G0090_001_dbl=That's right. We should be grateful just to have work at all.
M5560_S0030_G0100_001_dbl=Here's a reward. Take it.
M5560_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=No way, I can't accept this.
M5560_S0030_G0120_001_a2=I didn't work enough to earn this much.
M5560_S0030_G0130_001_dbl=It's fine. It's not like we have any use for it anyway.
M5560_S0030_G0140_001_ppl=Please, take it.
M5560_S0030_G0150_001_dbl=Hope you'll help us out again.
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, see anything you like?
