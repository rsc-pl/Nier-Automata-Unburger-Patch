M1030_S0400_G0000_001_a2b=We have to save the androids...
M1030_S0400_G0001_001_a2b=Thank you for saving me.
M1030_S0400_G0002_001_a9s=Ah, about the hacking?
M1030_S0400_G0003_001_a9s=Hacking is a specialty for us, Scanner models.
M1030_S0400_G0004_001_a9s=I'll support you anytime.
M1030_S0400_G0010_001_a9s=...It's no good. The circuits are all burnt out.
M1030_S0400_G0020_001_a9s=It seems they were barely being kept alive by the enemy's system...
M1030_S0400_G0030_001_a2b=...I see.
M1030_S0400_G0040_001_a9s=Hey... 2B.
M1030_S0400_G0050_001_a2b=What?
M1030_S0400_G0060_001_a9s=That Machine Lifeform was saying something strange.
M1030_S0400_G0070_001_a9s=As if, emotions...
M1030_S0400_G0080_001_a2b=Machine Lifeforms don't have consciousness...
M1030_S0400_G0090_001_a2b=The one who said that was you. 9S.
M1030_S0400_G0100_001_a9s=...That's... true.
M1030_S0400_G0110_001_a2b=Enemy...!
M1030_S0400_G0120_001_n02=I, not enemy.
M1030_S0400_G0130_001_a9s=Eh...?
M1030_S0400_G0140_001_n02=You guys, defeated broken Machine Lifeform for us.
M1030_S0400_G0150_001_a9s=To think a Machine Lifeform can use words this well...
M1030_S0400_G0160_001_n02=Give thanks... Come to our village.
M1030_S0400_G0170_001_sele=Go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0180_001_sele=Do not go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0190_001_a9s=It might be a trap but...
M1030_S0400_G0200_001_a9s=Shall we try going for the sake of information gathering for now?
M1030_S0400_G0210_001_a9s=It's certainly suspicious but...
M1030_S0400_G0220_001_a9s=I've never seen an individual that can communicate this much.
M1030_S0400_G0230_001_a9s=It might be worth checking out.
M1030_S0400_G0240_001_n02=We, have no intention to fight.
