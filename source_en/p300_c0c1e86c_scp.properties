M6010_S0090_G0100_300_op=You've changed my mind about you. Just what I'd expect. Don't go dying next time, either.
M6010_S0090_G0110_300_op=This is where it gets tough. Well then, good luck.
M6010_S0090_G0120_300_op=You were so cool~! Tell me all about it when you have time, 'kay~?
M6010_S0090_G0130_300_op=I think I'm becoming a fan~!
M6010_S0090_G0140_300_op=...Hey, you got a minute? I'm sorry for being so cold to you. It seems I misjudged you. Thank you for taking care of Eve.
M6010_S0090_G0150_300_op=I was able to relax for the first time in a while. And it's thanks to you and 9S.
M6010_S0090_G0160_300_op=Thanks to you, the war is turning in our favor. Thank you.
M6010_S0090_G0170_300_op=I feel like I can do my best next time, too.

M6010_S0090_G0220_300_op=That final battle was pretty tough, wasn't it? It's amazing you won! I was captivated.
M6010_S0090_G0230_300_op=Just between us, 2B-san is really popular among the operators! It's a secret, okay!
M6010_S0090_G0240_300_op=You did well to win. I was on the edge of my seat. I was the one assisting with Eve's remaining vitals display. Was it helpful?
M6010_S0090_G0250_300_op=Well, do your best not to die.

M6010_S0100_G0100_300_op=...We're in the middle of an operation. Do not speak to me.
M6010_S0100_G0110_300_op=...We're counting on you.
M6010_S0100_G0120_300_op=I'm already working, so don't talk to me~!

M6010_S0100_G0180_300_op=I'm expecting some amazing combat data this time, too. If you die, the data gets lost, so be careful.
M6010_S0100_G0190_300_op=...Don't die.
M6010_S0100_G0200_300_op=Don't worry, everyone's doing fine.

M6010_S0100_G0230_300_op=......
M6010_S0100_G0240_300_op=What a pain. It's starting again.
M6010_S0100_G0250_300_op=Don't worry, I'll give you perfect support.
M6010_S0100_G0260_300_op=It is almost time for deployment. Please head to the hangar.
M6010_S0100_G0270_300_op=Please launch from the hangar.
M6010_S0100_G0280_300_op=Hey, not right now! Don't talk to me!
M6010_S0100_G0290_300_op=Good luck!
M6010_S0100_G0300_300_op=This is the first time we've had an operation on this scale. Oh, don't worry. I've already expanded my memory.
