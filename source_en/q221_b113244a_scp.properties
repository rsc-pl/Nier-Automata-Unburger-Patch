M5221_S0010_G0130_001_a2=Why me...
M5221_S0010_G0140_001_robochild=They sell it at the tool shop in this village so go buy it!
M5221_S0010_G0141_001_robochild=Come to think of it, the children say they want to thank you.

M5221_S0010_G0170_001_sele=Don't buy.
M5221_S0010_G0180_001_a2=Alright... alright already...
M5221_S0010_G0190_001_robochildren=Kya! Yay!
M5221_S0010_G0200_001_a2=...I have no obligation to help with that.
M5221_S0010_G0210_001_robochildren=No way! Buy it!
M5221_S0010_G0220_001_a2=Shit...
M5221_S0010_G0230_001_robotoolshop=Welcome.
M5221_S0010_G0240_001_robotoolshop=...Eh? Playground equipment for children?
M5221_S0010_G0250_001_robotoolshop=Ah, right now, we are out of stock.
M5221_S0010_G0260_001_robotoolshop=If I had materials I could make it though...
M5221_S0010_G0270_001_robotoolshop=The materials are written here but...
M5221_S0010_G0280_001_robotoolshop=If you could bring these materials, I could make the children happy but...
M5221_S0010_G0290_001_a2=...
M5221_S0010_G0300_001_a2=Are all the residents of this village pushy?
M5221_S0010_G0310_001_robotoolshop=No no, not at all. Far from it...
M5221_S0010_G0320_001_a2=You're going to keep asking persistently even if I refuse anyway... I'll go collect them.
M5221_S0010_G0330_001_robotoolshop=Thank you!
M5221_S0010_G0340_001_robotoolshop=You should be able to gather the materials necessary for playground equipment at the Amusement Park.
M5221_S0010_G0350_001_a2=Hah!? That's damn far...
M5221_S0010_G0360_001_robotoolshop=I'm counting on you.
M5221_S0010_G0370_001_a2=Good grief... this is going to be a long haul.
M5221_S0010_G0380_001_robotoolshop=You should be able to gather the materials necessary for playground equipment at the Amusement Park.
M5221_S0010_G0390_001_robotoolshop=I'm counting on you.
M5221_S0020_G0000_001_a2=Alright...
M5221_S0020_G0010_001_a2=With this, the materials necessary for the playground equipment in Pascal's village are gathered.
M5221_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Shall I go to the tool shop.
M5221_S0030_G0000_001_robotoolshop=Ah, you gathered the materials for the toys?
M5221_S0030_G0010_001_robotoolshop=Immediately

M5221_S0030_G0020_001_robotoolshop=I made it, and went and installed it.
M5221_S0030_G0030_001_a2=Fast.
M5221_S0030_G0040_001_robotoolshop=The children are at the top of the village, on top of the slide, so if you like please go play with them.
M5221_S0030_G0050_001_robochild=Ah, it's Onee-chan!
M5221_S0030_G0060_001_robochildren=It's Onee-chan!
M5221_S0030_G0070_001_robochild=Thanks for making the playground equipment!
M5221_S0030_G0080_001_robochildren=Thanks!!
M5221_S0030_G0090_001_a2=Yeah.
M5221_S0030_G0100_001_robochild=Hey hey, Onee-chan.
M5221_S0030_G0110_001_a2=Wh-what? I granted your wish already, didn't I?
M5221_S0030_G0120_001_robochild=Nuh-uh. Here, a thank you from us.
M5221_S0030_G0130_001_robochild=Thank you okay!
M5221_S0030_G0140_001_robochildren=Thank you okay!
M5221_S0030_G0150_001_a2=...Yeah.
M5221_S0030_G0160_001_pascal=A2-san!
M5221_S0030_G0170_001_a2=Wa... Pascal.
M5221_S0030_G0180_001_pascal=Ah, sorry for surprising you.
M5221_S0030_G0190_001_pascal=I heard you made playground equipment for the children, thank you very much!
M5221_S0030_G0200_001_a2=Yeah.
M5221_S0030_G0215_001_pascal=Don't... overdo it too much okay.
M5221_S0030_G0220_001_pascal=Please come to play again anytime.
M5221_S0030_G0221_001_pascal=Peaceful Machine Lifeforms... huh.
M5221_S0030_G0222_001_pascal=Deduction: Further material acquisition is possible by forming a friendly relationship with Pascal and others.
M5221_S0030_G0223_001_pascal=Recommendation: Investigation of Pascal's village.
M5221_S0030_G0224_001_pascal=Hmph...
M6050_S0010_G1920_300_ps=Please look around as much as you like.
