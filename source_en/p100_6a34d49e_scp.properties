M0010_S0220_G0110_101_a9s=2B-san... I'm... glad.
M0010_S0220_G0120_101_a2b=About what?
M0010_S0220_G0130_101_a9s=We Scanner types mostly do our preliminary field surveys alone.
M0010_S0220_G0140_101_a9s=So, getting to work together with someone... it's fun.
M0010_S0220_G0150_101_a2b=...Emotions are prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G0160_101_a9s=Ah... My apologies!
M0010_S0220_G0170_101_a2b=Also...
M0010_S0220_G0180_101_a2b=You can drop the "-san".
M0010_S0220_G0190_101_a9s=...Huh?
M0010_S0220_G0200_101_a2b=Honorifics for my name are unnecessary.
M0010_S0220_G0210_101_a9s=...Got it. 2B!
M0010_S0220_G0220_101_a2b=These ruins are vast...
M0010_S0220_G0230_101_a9s=Apparently, this place used to be a human weapons factory a long time ago.
M0010_S0220_G0240_101_a9s=Though now, it's completely overrun with Machine Lifeforms...
M0010_S0220_G0250_101_a9s=It seems the enemy is reusing this factory to mass-produce more of them.
M0010_S0220_G0260_101_a2b=So they'll just keep spawning unless we wipe them all out...
M0010_S0220_G0266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G0267_101_a9s=It's just spewing nonsense using Old World data.
M0010_S0220_G0268_101_a9s=There's no meaning to anything the Machine Lifeforms do.
