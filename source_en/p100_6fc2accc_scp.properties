M1020_S0950_G0010_001_a2b=What in the world... was that Machine Lifeform...
M1020_S0950_G0020_001_a9s=It was a type we've never seen before.
M1020_S0950_G0030_001_a9s=Let's report it to Command later.
M1020_S0950_G0031_001_pod042=Movement through areas of high water flow is difficult.
M1020_S0950_G0032_001_pod042=Recommendation: Proceed along the rock ledge.
M1020_S0950_G0130_300_a9s=It stopped... We should be safe now that we've made it this far.
M1030_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Let's move to an area with a better signal so we can contact Command.
M1030_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=We can communicate with Command now.
M1030_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=9S to Bunker. Please respond.
M1030_S0010_G0030_001_op210=Operator to 9S. Message received.
M1030_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=A short while ago, we encountered a Machine Lifeform with a humanoid... that is, a texture similar to an android's.
M1030_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Unfortunately, we let it get away...
M1030_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=I'm sending the combat data from the encounter now.
M1030_S0010_G0070_001_op210=Roger. Initiating transfer.
M1030_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Alright, I'll leave the analysis to you.
M1030_S0010_G0081_001_a9s=...Phew. That's one thing taken care of.
M1030_S0010_G0082_001_a9s=2B, I'd like to talk about our plan from here on out.
M1030_S0010_G0083_001_a9s=I'm worried about the damage we took fighting that Machine Lifeform.
M1030_S0010_G0084_001_a9s=Should we return to the Resistance Camp for supplies and maintenance?
M1030_S0010_G0085_001_sele=Return to the Resistance Camp.
M1030_S0010_G0086_001_sele=Continue the mission.
M1030_S0010_G0087_001_a2b=You're right... Let's head back to the Resistance Camp for now.
M1030_S0010_G0088_001_a9s=Roger that.
M1030_S0010_G0089_001_a2b=No, we'll continue with the mission and eliminate the Machine Lifeforms.
M1030_S0010_G0090_001_op210=Operator to 9S. The data transfer is complete.
M1030_S0010_G0091_001_a9s=Roger. Just... don't overdo it, 2B.
M1030_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Roger that.
M1030_S0010_G0110_001_op210=On another matter, there's a message from the Commander for both 2B and 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Playing now.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=We've lost contact with several YoRHa units en route to the surface.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=However, their black box signals are still being confirmed, so we presume they are not deceased.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We have narrowed down the point of origin for the signals.
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=All YoRHa units currently stationed on the surface are ordered to investigate this matter.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=That is all. Terminating communication.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Come to think of it... I heard something similar at the Resistance Camp...
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=I've set the coordinates for the target location.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=I think we should get there as soon as we can.
M1030_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, 2B.
M1030_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=That Machine Lifeform in the desert... its appearance was identical to an android, wasn't it?
M1030_S0050_G0020_001_a2b=It was.
M1030_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=We androids are made in the image of our creators, the humans, but...
M1030_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=Why would the Machine Lifeforms imitate our appearance?
M1030_S0050_G0050_001_a2b=............
M1030_S0050_G0060_001_a2b=...It's a waste of time dwelling on things we can't figure out.
M1030_S0050_G0070_001_a9s=...You're right.
M1030_S0050_G0071_001_a9s=It seems the route from the surface is blocked...
M1030_S0050_G0072_001_a9s=Let's see if we can get there from underground.
M5920_S0010_G0100_001_pod042=Alert.
M5920_S0020_G0100_001_pod153=Alert.
