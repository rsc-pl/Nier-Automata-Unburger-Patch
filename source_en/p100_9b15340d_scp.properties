M1040_S0033_G0080_021_op210=Sortie orders have been issued to all YoRHa units.
M1040_S0033_G0090_001_a9s=A Large-scale Weapon...!
M1040_S0033_G0100_001_a9s=2B, just as I thought, these guys were trying to trap us...
M1040_S0033_G0110_001_pascal=...We did not know that information either.
M1040_S0033_G0120_001_pascal=You may not believe me, but...
M1040_S0033_G0130_001_pascal=If possible, I want you to believe me.
M1040_S0033_G0140_001_a2b=It doesn't matter. We're going to defeat it.
M1040_S0033_G0142_001_op210=Contact from Operator 21O.
M1040_S0033_G0150_021_op210=9S. There is one piece of bad news, and one piece of good news.
M1040_S0033_G0160_021_op210=First, we have confirmed the existence of two Giant Weapons.
M1040_S0033_G0170_021_a9s=Two of them... things like that...
M1040_S0033_G0180_021_op210=Next is the good news.
M1040_S0033_G0190_021_op210=We analyzed the enemy weapon armor from the combat data with the previous Giant Weapon,
M1040_S0033_G0200_021_op210=and succeeded in identifying a location thought to be a weak point.
M1040_S0033_G0210_021_op210=Also, improvement of the firing unit based on the obtained data is complete.
M1040_S0033_G0220_021_op210=We are deploying Flight Units equipped with it.
M1040_S0033_G0230_021_a9s=As expected of the YoRHa Development Department...
M1040_S0033_G0240_021_op210=Please check the map data.
M1040_S0033_G0250_021_a9s=Roger that!
M1040_S0033_G0260_001_a9s=2B! There was a contact from Command regarding the deployment of Flight Units.
M1040_S0033_G0270_001_a9s=I've pointed the coordinates, so let's head there!
M1040_S0033_G0280_001_a2b=Understood.
M1040_S0035_G0000_001_a9s=It's dangerous near the feet of the Large-scale Weapon...
M1040_S0035_G0010_001_a9s=I feel we should look for some other route.
M1040_S0035_G0020_001_a9s=The Flight Units are deployed on the building rooftop ahead...
M1040_S0035_G0021_001_a9s=It's dangerous, but it doesn't look like we can reach it without passing through the feet of that Large-scale Weapon.
M1040_S0035_G0030_001_a9s=Let's go carefully.
M1040_S0038_G0000_001_a9s=Waaah!!

M1040_S0038_G0040_001_a9s=Let's move to the Flight Unit location while we can!
M1040_S0040_G0000_011_op60=The sky is dangerous due to enemy anti-air weapons.
M1040_S0040_G0000_300_ysA=...!!
M1040_S0040_G0010_011_op60=Please approach by low-altitude flight.
M1040_S0040_G0010_300_ysA=I'm surprised. To think you defeated this guy with ground equipment.

M1040_S0040_G0040_021_op210=Approach by low-altitude flight is recommended.
