M1060_S0010_G0091_001_a9s=There are a lot of aggressive enemies here.
M1060_S0010_G0092_001_a9s=I wonder why some machine lifeforms attack and others don't...
M1060_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=The ground around here was destroyed during the last Great War...
M1060_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=The entire city is slowly sinking.
M1060_S0040_G0011_001_pod042=Defense target missiles discovered.
M1060_S0040_G0012_001_a2b=So we just need to protect those...?
M1060_S0040_G0020_001_a9s=Let's hurry up and beat them so we can take a bath, 2B!
M1060_S0040_G0030_001_a2b=Androids don't need to take baths.
M1060_S0040_G0040_001_a2b=As long as we have periodic parts-cleaning maintenance, there shouldn't be a problem.
M1060_S0040_G0050_001_a9s=C'mon, 2B... It's about the mood! The mood.
M1060_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=With this, we've pretty much eliminated the machine lifeforms in this area...
M1060_S0040_G0070_001_cmd=2B, 9S.
M1060_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Commander?
M1060_S0040_G0090_001_cmd=Emergency orders.
M1060_S0040_G0100_001_cmd=As you both know, our carrier is scheduled to make port for resupply.
M1060_S0040_G0110_001_cmd=However, that carrier has come under attack by machine lifeforms and has entered a state of combat.
M1060_S0040_G0120_001_cmd=I've already contacted all YoRHa units stationed in the City Ruins area, but I need you two to participate in the support effort as well.
M1060_S0040_G0130_001_cmd=Transferring map data and Flight Units.
M1060_S0040_G0140_001_cmd=That is all.
