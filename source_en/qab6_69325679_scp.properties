M1080_S0020_G0010_201_a9s=Yeah, yeah.
M1080_S0020_G0020_201_pod153=A single "Yes" is sufficient for recognition.
M1080_S0020_G0030_201_a9s=Yeees.
M1080_S0020_G0040_201_pod153=Memory area check complete. No issues found.
M1080_S0020_G0050_201_a9s=Roger.

M1080_S0020_G0090_201_pod153=All checks complete.
M1080_S0020_G0100_201_a9s=Phew... Finally, all the checks are done...
M1080_S0020_G0110_201_a9s=A full data overhaul is overkill.
M1080_S0020_G0120_201_pod153=Unit 9S was captured by the enemy and remained in an uncontrollable state for an extended period.
M1080_S0020_G0130_201_pod153=It is possible that an enemy Logic Virus was allowed to lay dormant during that time...
M1080_S0020_G0140_201_a9s=I get it, I get it.
M1080_S0020_G0150_201_a9s=Now I just have to sync my data with the Bunker's server and I'll be done.
M1080_S0020_G0160_201_a9s=What... was that?
M1080_S0020_G0170_201_pod153=Unknown.
M1080_S0020_G0180_201_a9s=Aborting data synchronization.
M1080_S0020_G0190_201_pod153=Warning: Data synchronization is a mandatory process for all YoRHa units.
M1080_S0020_G0200_201_a9s=There was some unclear noise.
M1080_S0020_G0210_201_a9s=Put 2B's data synchronization process on hold for now, too.
M1080_S0020_G0220_201_pod153=Roger.
M1080_S0020_G0230_201_a9s=To be absolutely safe, I'm going to find the source of the data noise.
M1080_S0020_G0240_201_a9s=Open a port to the server.
M1080_S0020_G0250_201_a9s=Checking everything is impossible... I'll narrow my search to the important points.
M1080_S0020_G0260_201_pod153=Detection: Port log to the Council of Humanity's Lunar Server.
M1080_S0020_G0270_201_a9s=Why is there a firewall here of all places...?
M1080_S0020_G0280_201_a9s=Is this a record of material shipments to the moon?
M1080_S0020_G0290_201_a9s=But this is strange... There's an awful lot of empty containers.
M1080_S0020_G0300_201_a9s=Why would they do something so... meaningless?
M1080_S0020_G0310_201_pod153=Detection: YoRHa Unit Storage Records.
M1080_S0020_G0320_201_a9s=What's the point of defending it this heavily...?
M1080_S0020_G0330_201_a9s=Only the information regarding Black Boxes has been completely wiped...
M1080_S0020_G0340_201_a9s=Hmm...? A new port just opened.
M1080_S0020_G0350_201_pod153=Detection: Council of Humanity and Project YoRHa Record Index.
M1080_S0020_G0360_201_pod153=Warning: Access to this data is not authorized.
M1080_S0020_G0370_201_a9s=...There's too much strange data.
M1080_S0020_G0380_201_a9s=I have to check this data too.
M1080_S0020_G0390_201_a9s=An offensive firewall!?
M1080_S0020_G0400_201_a9s=To think they'd install something like this inside the server...
M1080_S0020_G0410_201_a9s=This data... Inside Project YoRHa, there's a heading for the formulation of the Council of Humanity...
M1080_S0020_G0420_201_a9s=If that's right, the order is reversed...
M1080_S0020_G0430_201_a9s=After many battles and adventures, the Prophet speaks.
M1080_S0020_G0440_201_a9s=Ah, the mercy of the earth.
M1080_S0020_G0450_201_a9s=Ah, the joy of the heavens.
M1080_S0020_G0460_201_a9s=Released from the iron yoke,
M1080_S0020_G0470_201_a9s=Our souls are...
M1080_S0020_G0480_201_a9s=...
M1080_S0020_G0490_201_a9s=What was that... just now?
M1080_S0020_G0500_201_a9s=Dammit! Was I found?
M1080_S0020_G0510_201_pod153=Negative: It is an emergency support request from 2B.
M1080_S0020_G0520_201_a9s=Disconnect from the server. Activate body unit.
M1080_S0020_G0530_201_a9s=Roger.
