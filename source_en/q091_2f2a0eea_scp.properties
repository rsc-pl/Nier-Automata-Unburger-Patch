M6120_S0000_G0000_001_resi=Man, this place really is the best!
M6120_S0000_G0010_001_resi=I hear you've been getting popular lately. I'm expecting great things from you!
M6120_S0000_G0020_001_resi=Thanks to you defeating the S-Rank champion, that guy's back in a cell for the time being. Thanks a lot!
M6120_S0010_G0000_001_resi=The higher-ups think this kinda fun is illegal. Bunch of idiots, the lot of 'em.
M6120_S0010_G0010_001_resi=I hear you're pretty strong. I'll have to come watch one of your matches.
M6120_S0010_G0020_001_resi=Man, your match was incredible!
M6120_S0010_G0030_001_resi=Some idiots badmouth this place sometimes, but they're just pitiful fools who don't get how fun it is here. You think so too, right?
M6120_S0020_G0000_001_resi=How about it? Are you having fun?
M6120_S0020_G0010_001_resi=You're starting to get how to have fun here too, right?
M6120_S0020_G0020_001_resi=Wondering why this place hasn't been shut down?
M6120_S0020_G0030_001_resi=Even the top brass aren't idiots. They know this place exists and give it their silent approval.
M6120_S0020_G0040_001_resi=They get it. Letting people blow off steam here keeps them from rebelling or deserting.
M6120_S0020_G0050_001_resi=Besides, some of the money from here flows right to the top.\nWell, that's just how organizations are.
M6120_S0020_G0060_001_resi=It's for your own good. Best not to stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
M6120_S0030_G0000_001_resi=Everywhere's a battlefield these days.\nIf it weren't for this place, I would've deserted long ago.
M6120_S0030_G0010_001_resi=Thanks to you smashing those Machine Lifeforms to bits, all my stress is gone. Thanks!
M6120_S0030_G0020_001_resi=Ever since I found this place, killing Machine Lifeforms on the battlefield has been so, so fun. It's the best.
M6120_S0040_G0000_001_resi=Thanks to this place, I can get through all the tough jobs.
M6120_S0040_G0010_001_resi=Ah, thanks to this place, I can keep going tomorrow.
M6120_S0040_G0020_001_resi=The way you break those Machine Lifeforms... it was just the best!
M6120_S0050_G0000_001_resi=I've got some... good stuff in stock, you know?
M6120_S0050_G0010_001_resi=Can't be helped. It's a bit dangerous, but I guess I'll try stocking up from the Underground Cave.
M6120_S0050_G0020_001_resi=It's been a while since someone cleared the highest rank. You'd make a good hunter.
M6120_S0060_G0000_001_resi=I'd like to stock up on a new one for 10,000G, but...
M6120_S0060_G0010_001_resi=The one I bought the other day was useless, broke right away. Give me something tougher.
M6120_S0060_G0020_001_resi=Oh, I saw your match! With skill like that, bring me a real lively one!
M6120_S0070_G0000_001_resi=Sorry, but this area is off-limits.
M6120_S0070_G0020_001_resi=How about it? You won't find many shows more interesting than this, right?
M6120_S0080_G0000_001_resi=Dammit! Dammit!\nBecause that guy lost, my fortune went up in smoke!
M6120_S0080_G0010_001_resi=Look at that, look at that! I won, I actually won! Look at this fortune! Ahahaha!
M6120_S0080_G0020_001_resi=Huh? What happened to the other guy who was here?
M6120_S0080_G0030_001_resi=He kept losing and couldn't pay back his debt, so he got dragged off somewhere. What an idiot.
M6120_S0080_G0040_001_resi=I can still keep going. Alright, next time I'm aiming for an even bigger long shot...
M6120_S0090_G0000_001_resi=This is bad, this is bad, this is bad... How am I ever gonna pay back this much money...
M6120_S0100_G0000_001_resi=Only participants in the arena are permitted beyond this point.
M6120_S0100_G0010_001_resi=If you wish to participate, please complete the registration process at the reception desk.
M6120_S0110_G0000_001_resi=Hmm, should I play it safe, or aim for the long shot... I'm torn...
M6120_S0110_G0010_001_resi=Oh, I saw your match! Next time, I'm definitely betting on you!
M6120_S0110_G0020_001_resi=To think you'd beat the champion of the arena... I should've bet on you.
M6120_S0110_G0030_001_resi=I'm definitely betting on you next time, so let me know when you're competing!
M6120_S0120_G0000_001_resi=What are you doing!?\nIf you don't break 'em more spectacularly, it's boring!
M6120_S0120_G0010_001_resi=Don't you dare fall behind a piece of junk like that, damn you!
M6120_S0120_G0020_001_resi=Hey, you! Don't stop! Even after you break it, tear it to shreds!
M6120_S0130_G0000_001_resi=All right!!\nThat's it, smash 'em!
M6120_S0130_G0010_001_resi=Whoaaa!!\nYour match was incredibly exciting!
M6120_S0130_G0020_001_resi=WOOOOAH!!\nTo think you'd actually take down that champion! I was blown away!
M6120_S0140_G0000_001_resi=When I watch Machine Lifeforms burst apart, something in my chest feels... organized.
M6120_S0140_G0010_001_resi=I wonder how I should describe this feeling.
M6120_S0140_G0020_001_resi=I looked through some old human literature, and I guess the feeling you get watching Machine Lifeforms explode is something close to "exhilarating," "joyful," or "cathartic."
M6120_S0140_G0030_001_resi=We've been through hell and back because of those Machine Lifeforms.\nThe sight of them being broken is truly exhilarating.
M6120_S0140_G0040_001_resi=Ahahaha, it's so joyful! The sight of them breaking is truly, truly joyful!
M6120_S0150_G0000_001_resi=What are you doing, you piece of junk!?
M6120_S0150_G0010_001_resi=I bet my money on you, so fight like you're gonna die!
M6120_S0150_G0020_001_resi=I saw your match. If it's you, you might just be able to break that damn, cocky S-Rank champion. I'm counting on you.
M6120_S0150_G0030_001_resi=That was amazing! Thanks to you defeating the champion, I get to keep him as my slave for a little longer.
M6120_S0160_G0000_001_resi=Ahh, you can't beat the front row!
M6120_S0160_G0010_001_resi=I can't get enough of it when stray bullets fly over here!
M6120_S0160_G0020_001_resi=It gives me the shivers, you know?
M6120_S0160_G0030_001_resi=Lately, not many bullets fly over, even in the front row...
M6120_S0160_G0040_001_resi=More, more! Send more bullets this way! Give me the thrill, the THRILL!
M6120_S0160_G0060_001_resi=To think you conquered S-Rank, that's amazing!
M6120_S0160_G0070_001_resi=Ah, I want to be showered in more of those dangerous S-Rank bullets!
M6120_S0170_G0000_001_resi=You're new here.\nIf you're going to bet, you'd better be careful.
M6120_S0170_G0010_001_resi=Plenty of people have gone bankrupt here. They all get taken somewhere and never come back.
M6120_S0170_G0020_001_resi=So you're the android everyone's been talking about. Tell me... are you enjoying this facility?
M6120_S0170_G0030_001_resi=This place embodies the law of the jungle, where only the strong can find enjoyment.
M6120_S0170_G0040_001_resi=However, I have my doubts as to whether androids are truly the strong ones in this world.
M6120_S0170_G0050_001_resi=You, what do you think of this place?
M6120_S0170_G0060_001_resi=Androids who've had countless comrades killed have a just cause for killing Machine Lifeforms.
M6120_S0170_G0070_001_resi=But most of the people here are just using that "just cause" as a shield to enjoy the act of killing.
M6120_S0170_G0080_001_resi=Perhaps, as long as they can kill, it wouldn't even matter if their opponent wasn't a Machine Lifeform.
M6120_S0170_G0090_001_resi=And yet, there are many here whose will to live has been reignited thanks to this facility.
M6120_S0170_G0100_001_resi=I wonder who could possibly judge whether the people here are sane or mad...
M6120_S0180_G0000_001_resi=Dammit, another loss!
M6120_S0180_G0010_001_resi=Maybe I should just enter the battle myself...
M6120_S0180_G0020_001_resi=Ow ow ow...
M6120_S0180_G0030_001_resi=Dammit, I never should have entered the battle!
M6120_S0190_G0000_001_resi=As I thought, the low-rank matches are boring to watch...
M6120_S0190_G0010_001_resi=I want to see the high-rank matches, but they're so expensive...
M6120_S0190_G0020_001_resi=I thoroughly enjoyed your match.
M6120_S0190_G0030_001_resi=The tickets are expensive for a reason. The high-rank matches are a cut above the rest.
M6120_S0190_G0040_001_resi=It's scary how you can get used to things.\nThose high-rank matches that were once so thrilling have now become boring.
M6120_S0190_G0050_001_resi=We androids are surprisingly greedy creatures, aren't we?
M6120_S0200_G0000_001_resi=The S-Rank champion is an incredible fighter. He's currently on a 90-win streak.
M6120_S0200_G0010_001_resi=The matches he's in are so popular, it's hard to get a ticket.
M6120_S0200_G0020_001_resi=I watched you fight. You've got some real skill.
M6120_S0200_G0030_001_resi=The champion has kept on winning since then. He's achieved 96 consecutive victories.
M6120_S0200_G0040_001_resi=I wonder which will come first: him reaching 100 wins, or you finally taking him down...
M6120_S0200_G0050_001_resi=Ah you, it seems you defeated the King.
M6120_S0200_G0060_001_resi=I thought he would be the one to get 100 wins and finally escape this place, but...
M6120_S0200_G0070_001_resi=In the end, perhaps neither androids nor Machine Lifeforms can escape their predetermined fate...
M6120_S0210_G0000_001_resi=Ah, no good... Looks like I'm out of luck today.
M6120_S0210_G0010_001_resi=Seems your winning streak continues. You must be lucky.
M6120_S0210_G0020_001_resi=You can't fight the flow of luck, but you can invite it in.\nLuck is a strange thing.
M6120_S0210_G0030_001_resi=So you defeated the arena's champion. I thought he was the kind of guy who could call in his own luck, but...
M6120_S0210_G0040_001_resi=Well, he had no luck, and you did. Maybe it's as simple as that.
M6120_S0220_G0000_001_resi=UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
M6120_S0220_G0010_001_resi=Phew, shouting at the top of my lungs feels great!
M6120_S0220_G0020_001_resi=SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
M6120_S0220_G0030_001_resi=I just can't stop shouting! Why don't you join me?
M6120_S0220_G0040_001_resi=...Shouted... too... much... Vocal cords... are... bro... ken...
M6120_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Android-san, please, I have a request for you.
M6120_S0230_G0010_001_n02=My body is weak. I will likely never escape from this hell...
M6120_S0230_G0020_001_n02=Therefore, I ask... could you please kill me and put me out of my misery?
M6120_S0230_G0030_001_n02=I have lost my family. I have nothing left.
M6120_S0230_G0040_001_n02=Rather than endure eternal suffering in this hell...
M6120_S0230_G0050_001_n02=This may be an unpleasant request for you, but...
M6120_S0230_G0060_001_n02=Please... please kill me...
M6120_S0240_G0000_001_toolshop=Oh, yer a new face!\nHere for a match, are ya? Then get yerself ready right here!
M6120_S0240_G0010_001_toolshop=Eh? My way of speakin' is strange?
M6120_S0240_G0020_001_toolshop=I learned it from some old documents. Apparently, it's the kinda talk ya use to be a successful merchant.
M6120_S0240_G0030_001_toolshop=Eh? Is somethin' about it weird?
M6120_S0240_G0040_001_toolshop=I only just learned it, so don't sweat the small stuff!
M6120_S0240_G0050_001_toolshop=Welcome! Look around as much as ya like!
M6120_S0240_G0060_001_toolshop=Thanks for yer business!
