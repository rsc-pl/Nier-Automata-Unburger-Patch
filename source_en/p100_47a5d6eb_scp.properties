M1040_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=Everyone has... white flags?
M1040_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=2B, I know you're not enthusiastic, but why don't we listen to what the Machine Lifeforms have to say? I'm curious about their intentions.
M1040_S0030_G0005_300_a9s=Recommendation: Investigation of the Machine Lifeform settlement.\nReporting to Command is difficult with current information.
M1040_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=Does this mean... they have no intention to fight?
M1040_S0030_G0010_300_a2b=9S, let's return and hear the information from the Machine Lifeforms.
M1040_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=This village really is... something is strange.
M1040_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=Let's go back and investigate.
M1040_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=...First of all,
M1040_S0030_G0100_001_pascal=there is something I would like you to hear.
M1040_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=We are not your enemies.
M1040_S0030_G0120_001_a9s=2B! You can't trust what a Machine Lifeform says!
M1040_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=...Certainly, to you, we Machine Lifeforms are enemies.
M1040_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=My name is Pascal. I serve as the chief of this village.
M1040_S0030_G0150_001_pascal=Those who live in this village... are only pacifists who have fled from battle.
M1040_S0030_G0160_001_pascal=If you are willing, please verify this with your own eyes...
M1040_S0030_G0170_001_pascal=What do you think?
M1040_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Uwah... He started communicating on his own...
M1040_S0030_G0190_001_pascal=Have you understood that we love peace?
M1040_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=You can say whatever you want with just words...
M1040_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=Because machines don't have hearts.
M1040_S0030_G0220_001_pascal=...That may be so.
M1040_S0030_G0230_001_pascal=But, if you are willing, please come to this village from now on.
M1040_S0030_G0240_001_pascal=Mutual understanding cannot be obtained except through dialogue... That is what I believe.
M1040_S0030_G0250_001_a2b=Is that so...
M1040_S0031_G0000_001_pascal=Oh, right. We also have interactions with you androids.
M1040_S0031_G0010_001_pascal=Please take this to Anemone-san at the Resistance Camp.
M1040_S0031_G0020_001_a9s=This is...?
M1040_S0031_G0030_001_pascal=It is a filtration filter for fuel that Anemone-san asked for.
M1040_S0031_G0040_001_pascal=If you hand this over, I think you will understand that we are a peaceful species.
M1040_S0031_G0050_001_a2b=...Understood.
M1040_S0031_G0060_001_a9s=Anemone-san, we have something we're holding onto from a Machine Lifeform named Pascal...
M1040_S0031_G0070_001_ane=Ah, the fuel filter? I was just running short on them.
M1040_S0031_G0080_001_ane=...Wait, you met Pascal?
M1040_S0031_G0090_001_a9s=Yes... Anemone-san, are you in contact with Machine Lifeforms?
M1040_S0031_G0100_001_ane=...Yeah. The folks in that village are harmless, and they are skilled at detailed work that we can't do.
M1040_S0031_G0110_001_ane=In exchange, we hand over oil and materials. It's a type of trade.
M1040_S0031_G0120_001_a9s=Is... that so.
M1040_S0031_G0130_001_ane=If you are going back, take this high-viscosity oil to Pascal.
M1040_S0031_G0140_001_ane=If you meet Pascal, please give him the high-viscosity oil.
M1040_S0031_G0150_001_ane=Sorry for always relying on you... Oh, right.
M1040_S0031_G0160_001_ane=I have prepared a room exclusively for you YoRHa troops.
M1040_S0031_G0170_001_ane=Please use it as you like, anytime.
M1040_S0031_G0180_001_pascal=Ah! You brought the high-viscosity oil for me.
M1040_S0031_G0190_001_pascal=Anemone-san is kind and understanding, it helps us.
M1040_S0031_G0200_001_pascal=It would be nice if all androids and Machine Lifeforms could live peacefully like this...
M1040_S0031_G0210_001_a9s=...That's just a pipe dream.
M1040_S0031_G0220_001_pascal=That is true... If you are willing, please try interacting with the other robots as well.
M5920_S0090_G0130_001_human=To the androids fighting hard on the surface, this is the Council of Humanity on the moon.
M5920_S0090_G0140_001_human=Several thousand years have passed since we were attacked by aliens and their vanguard, the Machine Lifeforms.
M5920_S0090_G0150_001_human=And, we humans ended up escaping to the moon.
M5920_S0090_G0160_001_human=However, even now, thanks to your battles, we are able to continue existing.
M5920_S0090_G0170_001_human=You android soldiers are the last hope of us humanity.
M5920_S0090_G0180_001_human=We expect your brave fighting.
M5920_S0090_G0190_001_human=Glory to Mankind.
M5920_S0100_G0080_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B-san. It's time for the periodic contact... Waaah.
M5920_S0100_G0090_001_a2b=This is 2B. What happened?
M5920_S0100_G0100_001_op60=Actually, I invited a senior I kinda liked to a meal, and got rejected...
M5920_S0100_G0110_001_op60=How should I go on living from now on... 2B-san...
M5920_S0100_G0120_001_a2b=E-Even if you ask me... such things.
M5920_S0100_G0130_001_op60=I can't stay in the Bunker anymore...
M5920_S0100_G0140_001_a2b=...That is a problem. It will hinder the mission.
M5920_S0100_G0150_001_op60=...2B-san, do you need me?
M5920_S0100_G0160_001_a2b=Operator support is indispensable for B-type combat models.
M5920_S0100_G0170_001_a2b=Therefore...
M5920_S0100_G0180_001_op60=2B-san...
M5920_S0100_G0190_001_a2b=...That is all. Ending communication.
M5920_S0100_G0380_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. Conducting periodic contact.
M5920_S0100_G0390_001_op210=Today, I have an important matter to communicate to 9S.
M5920_S0100_G0400_001_a9s=What is it?
M5920_S0100_G0410_001_op210=A complaint has come in from the Maintenance Department regarding 9S's handling of the flight unit.
M5920_S0100_G0420_001_op210=They want you to stop modifying it without permission.
M5920_S0100_G0430_001_a9s=No, but the information from the satellite had extraneous data, causing a lag in shooting correction, so I had no choice...
M5920_S0100_G0440_001_op210=If you have a counterargument, please go to the Maintenance Department yourself and resolve it by talking to them or punching them.
M5920_S0100_G0450_001_op210=That is all.
M5920_S0100_G0460_001_a9s=...I wonder if Operators are unexpectedly rough.
