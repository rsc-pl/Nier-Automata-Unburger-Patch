M1080_S0080_G0080_201_a9s=Alright.
M1080_S0080_G0090_201_a9s=Next, just like this, I'll unlock the room where 2B-san is...
M1080_S0080_G0091_201_a9s=That Machine Lifeform... looks to have higher durability than this unit...
M1080_S0080_G0092_201_a9s=Let's switch via hacking before it becomes wary of me.
M1080_S0080_G0100_300_a9s=To head to the room where 2B-san is... should I just head to the lower layer of the factory like this...
M1080_S0080_G0110_300_a9s=Oh no!? \n...I have to go to 2B-san's location quickly.
M1080_S0080_G0120_300_a9s=Shit! \nIt might have been better to switch to a unit with more power...
M1080_S0080_G0150_300_a9s=The wreckage of stopped robots...
M1080_S0080_G0160_300_a9s=Looks like some are still usable. \nI'll send these coordinates to the Bunker just in case.
M1080_S0080_G0200_300_n02=Stop!!
M1080_S0080_G0210_300_n02=Become God!
M1080_S0080_G0220_300_n02=What are you thinking!! Is your circuit broken!?
M1080_S0080_G0230_300_n02=Become God! Become God! Become God!
M1080_S0080_G0240_300_n02=What on earth has happened to everyone...
