M5222_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2-san.
M5222_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=Regarding the playground, thank you very much. \nI am truly grateful...
M5222_S0010_G0020_001_pascal=Those children are, to me...
M5222_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=No, they are a treasure to this village, and the hope of the future.
M5222_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=Do you think it is strange for us Machine Lifeforms to speak of the future?
M5222_S0010_G0050_001_a2=...Who knows.
M5222_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=If it's those children, surely, they will not lose to this barren conflict, and open up a new path.
M5222_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=I believe so. But...
M5222_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=Actually, among the village children, there is a child whose memory element is in bad condition.
M5222_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=At this rate that child will...
M5222_S0010_G0100_001_a2=Why not repair it?
M5222_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=The thing is, we lack the necessary materials.
M5222_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Those materials can only be obtained at the factory ruins, but there are many ferocious Machine Lifeforms there...
M5222_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=Thinking if it's A2-san, I am swallowing my shame and asking you.
M5222_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Lend a hand.
M5222_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Refuse.
M5222_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=Is that so... if your circumstances allow it, please consider it.
M5222_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=To repair the village child, materials are necessary.
M5222_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Could you please lend a hand?
M5222_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=Thank you very much!
M5222_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=The necessary materials are in the factory ruins, so please, I am counting on you.
M5222_S0010_G0210_001_pascal=The materials necessary for the child's repair are in the factory ruins.
M5222_S0010_G0220_001_pascal=It is a great trouble, but I am counting on you.
M5222_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Destruction of hostile Machine Lifeforms confirmed.
M5222_S0020_G0010_001_a2=Is this the memory element material Pascal wanted?
M5222_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Killing other Machine Lifeforms to protect a Machine Lifeform child...
M5222_S0020_G0030_001_a2=...
M5222_S0020_G0040_001_a2=Let's deliver the materials to Pascal.
M5222_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=Ah! A2-san. You gathered the materials to repair the child.
M5222_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=Thank you very much.
M5222_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=This, I think it is very insufficient, but as thanks...
M5222_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=...Actually, without going out of the way to repair, we could just transfer the core to a new body.
M5222_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=If we do that, we can come back to life as many times as we want.
M5222_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=However... memories are lost.
M5222_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=That, I feel... would no longer be that child.
M5222_S0030_G0070_001_pascal=Truly, thank you very much!
