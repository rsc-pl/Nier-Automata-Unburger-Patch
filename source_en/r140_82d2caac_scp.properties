M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=We won't fight! We won't fight!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill us! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We haven't done anything bad...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M5040_S0010_G0145_001_papa=Please, save my child...
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=...I heard my little sister was found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=To think she would stop moving before me...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Wonderful! Thank you for such valuable information...
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=This is a token of gratitude. Please accept it.
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Ugh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is as Mr. Sartre says.
M6050_S0010_G1270_300_villager=A little while ago, I heard a terrible sound from the direction of the City Ruins.
M6050_S0010_G1280_300_villager=N-No matter what, I will protect the village...!
M6050_S0010_G1290_300_villager=B-But, I wonder if the shift change time will come soon.
M6050_S0010_G1300_300_villager=This place should be safe... Probably.
M6050_S0010_G1310_300_villager=A loud sound was heard in the distance.
M6050_S0010_G1320_300_villager=Were you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1330_300_villager=Please make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G1340_300_kj=There was a huge earthquake, were you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1350_300_kj=They say "if you're prepared, there's no worry". Look around as much as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1360_300_kj=I hope the guy in the forest is safe too...
M6050_S0010_G1370_300_kj=You can come to look anytime.
M6050_S0010_G1380_300_sp=Oh, you were safe. I am happy to meet you again.
M6050_S0010_G1390_300_sp=Will you look at something?
M6050_S0010_G1400_300_sp=Please come to see me anytime.
M6050_S0010_G1430_300_villager=I was surprised by the earthquake and ended up dropping one torso.
M6050_S0010_G1440_300_villager=This is troubling... Where on earth did it go.
M6050_S0010_G1450_300_villager=I picked up a torso because it was dropped!
M6050_S0010_G1460_300_villager=Fufu, did I become cool with this?
M6050_S0010_G1470_300_villager=Still not enough... I want more.
M6050_S0010_G1480_300_villager=I heard a very loud sound, so I came to see the state of the forest.
M6050_S0010_G1490_300_villager=I hope the creatures of the forest aren't surprised.
M6050_S0010_G1500_300_villager=When facing danger alone, people become strong.
M6050_S0010_G1510_300_villager=The solitary man is indeed a true warrior.
M6050_S0010_G1520_300_villager=But, it's okay to come play once in a while.
M6050_S0010_G1530_300_pascal=Ah, you were safe. There was a very large earthquake, so I was worried.
M6050_S0010_G1540_300_pascal=It is good that neither the villagers nor you all were injured.
M6050_S0010_G1550_300_villager=We don't have anything impressive, but please make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G1560_300_villager=I heard a very loud sound! It was scary, but a little fun!
M6050_S0010_G1570_300_villager=What shall I play next.
M6050_S0010_G1580_300_villager=It shook a lot! It was a huge sound!
M6050_S0010_G1590_300_villager=Let's play while being a little careful.
M6050_S0010_G1600_300_villager=It was a very large earthquake...
M6050_S0010_G1610_300_villager=Were you okay? I am okay.
M6050_S0010_G1650_300_villager=In my house, everything is within reach.
M6050_S0010_G1660_300_villager=It's a comfortable life with no inconveniences.
M6050_S0010_G1670_300_villager=I don't own a house.
M6050_S0010_G1680_300_villager=There are inconvenient parts, but my heart is always free.
M6050_S0010_G1690_300_villager=It seems there was an explosion in the distance, were you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1700_300_villager=Don't get too close to dangerous places.
M6050_S0010_G1770_300_villager=Hmm.
M6050_S0010_G1780_300_villager=...Right now, I'm thinking of a game that can be done even with short legs.
M6050_S0010_G1790_300_villager=Maybe Tag is fine after all.
M6050_S0010_G1800_300_villager=Tag isn't bad either, is it.
M6050_S0010_G1810_300_villager=Just because the body is big doesn't necessarily mean it's strong...
M6050_S0010_G1820_300_villager=Damn... If only my body was big like that guy...
M6050_S0010_G1830_300_villager=More... Grant me a bigger body...
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible.
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. It's nice weather today too, isn't it.
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you have any business, please say so.
M6050_S0010_G3070_300_villager=I've fully enjoyed this place, so I want to go to another place soon,\nbut the pick-up isn't coming easily.
M6050_S0010_G3080_300_villager=Good grief, being late for the promised time, what a loose guy. \nMaybe he got mad because I asked him to carry me too much.
M6050_S0010_G3090_300_villager=I got tired from carrying my friend. \nTaking a little break, resting, resting.
