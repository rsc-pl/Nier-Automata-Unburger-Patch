M5650_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah... I'm in trouble...
M5650_S0010_G0010_001_sele=I don't know what it is, but I'll listen.
M5650_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Feels troublesome, so I'll do it later.
M5650_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=Ugh... I'm beat. What should I do...
M5650_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=If it's alright, won't you tell me what you're troubled about?
M5650_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=I might be able to help.
M5650_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=Ah... You're the people from the Bunker.
M5650_S0010_G0070_001_resiman=Actually, I have to prepare "Cargo for Transport", but I can't get it out.
M5650_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=Originally, a senior android was in charge, but there's too much cargo and I can't move it.
M5650_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=This is trouble... At this rate, Senpai will get mad at me...
M5650_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=I have to go get the "Cargo for Transport" that was forgotten inside this warehouse in the back, but...
M5650_S0020_G0000_300_resiman=Will you go get it for me?
M5650_S0020_G0010_001_pod153=Marking objects thought to be "Cargo for Transport".
M5650_S0020_G0010_300_sele=Guess I have no choice.
M5650_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=...Even saying that, I can't carry it out like this.
M5650_S0020_G0020_300_sele=I'm busy right now.
M5650_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=*Sigh*... I have to make it passable first.
M5650_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=I'm counting on you!
M5650_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=With this, all the "Cargo for Transport" is gathered.
M5650_S0020_G0040_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside once to refresh mood.
M5650_S0020_G0050_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside once to refresh mood.
M5650_S0020_G0051_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside and deliver cargo to requester.
M5650_S0020_G0052_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside and deliver cargo to requester.
M5650_S0020_G0060_300_sele=Go outside.
M5650_S0020_G0070_300_sele=Continue work.
M5650_S0020_G0080_300_resiman=It's bad since you came all this way, but I think you should concentrate on your mission right now.
M5650_S0020_G0090_300_resiman=I want you to come again when things settle down.
M5650_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=Wah! You brought the cargo! You saved me, thank you!
M5650_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=You placed the cargo way too haphazardly. I couldn't walk properly, you know?
M5650_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Why don't you organize it a little?
M5650_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=Ugh... I'm terribly sorry. I'll tell Senpai...
M5650_S0030_G0040_001_resiman=Here, it's small, but a thank you. Please accept it.
M5650_S0030_G0050_001_resiman=Good grief... Materials management isn't easy either...
M5651_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Marking objects thought to be "Cargo for Transport".
