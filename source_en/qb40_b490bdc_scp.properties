M6010_S0010_G0090_300_op=I never get tired of looking at Earth, no matter how much I watch...
M6010_S0010_G0100_300_op=You can get to the Hangar from the side elevator, you know?
M6010_S0010_G0110_300_op=I hope the day we can return to Earth comes soon...together with humanity.
M6010_S0010_G0120_300_opa=Oh, hello.
M6010_S0010_G0130_300_opa=You two have become quite the rumor.
M6010_S0010_G0140_300_opb=Blowing up a huge thing with a Black Box BOOM, that's amazing~
M6010_S0010_G0150_300_opa=Don't be too reckless and actually die, okay?
M6010_S0010_G0160_300_opb=We'll take good care of your data, so please upload diligently~
M6010_S0010_G0170_300_opa=If you want to go to the Command Room, you should go left.
M6010_S0010_G0180_300_opb=The Server Management Room is to the right~
M6010_S0010_G0190_300_opa=Take care.
M6010_S0010_G0200_300_opb=See you later~
M6010_S0010_G0840_300_op=Hello.
M6010_S0010_G0850_300_ys=I was just talking about the plants and animals I saw on the surface.\nOperators seem to like data collection.
M6010_S0010_G0860_300_op=I'm jealous of the combat squadron. If it were permitted, I'd want to go directly\nand collect data...
M6010_S0010_G0870_300_ys=If I could get permission, I could take you along. I guess it's difficult though.
M6010_S0010_G0880_300_op=Listening to various things about Earth is fun, but everyone returning safely\nis what makes me happiest.
M6010_S0010_G0890_300_op=So you two as well, don't make me worry, okay?
M6010_S0010_G0900_300_op=Hey, hello.\nAre you using the Recovery Medicine?
M6010_S0010_G0910_300_op=It's the pride of our Technological Development Department.\nYou can buy it from this monitor in your private room, so by all means use it.
M6010_S0010_G0920_300_op=Hmm? Do you need something?\n...The product lineup is small, you say?
M6010_S0010_G0930_300_op=It can't be helped, the Bunker has limited supplies.\nWe are currently developing enthusiastically, so please wait a bit.
M6010_S0010_G1060_300_ysA=...Uugh... I feel sick...
M6010_S0010_G1070_300_ysB=This guy, his equilibrium organs are shot,\nand despite being an Android, he gets motion sickness.
M6010_S0010_G1080_300_ysB=We've repaired him many times, but it doesn't seem to get fixed.\nI wonder if it's become a habit?
M6010_S0010_G1090_300_ysB=You guys be careful too.
M6010_S0010_G1100_300_ysB=Are you okay? Can you return?
M6010_S0010_G1110_300_ysA=............Impossible...
M6010_S0010_G1120_300_ysB=...I guess I'll ask so you don't have to move via Flight Unit.
M6010_S0010_G1130_300_ysA=Good work. Sortieing now?
M6010_S0010_G1140_300_ysB=Nice, I want to keep flying too.
M6010_S0010_G1150_300_op=Flight Units are expensive, so I won't forgive wasteful use, okay?
M6010_S0010_G1160_300_op=Even without that, the combat squadron treats them roughly.\nYou scratched the fuselage just the other day, didn't you?
M6010_S0010_G1170_300_op=Who do you think cleans up the paint you peeled off?\nRuining a beautiful fuselage, being like that...
M6010_S0010_G1180_300_ysA=Stop! We were wrong, so that's enough, right?
M6010_S0010_G1190_300_ysB=If only they could attach wings and jets to the body itself.\nShould I try asking the Development Department?
M6010_S0010_G1200_300_op=That sounds good, the Flight Units wouldn't get damaged either.
M6010_S0010_G1210_300_ysA=I tried asking before, but it was rejected because the body couldn't withstand it\nor the cost was too high.
M6010_S0010_G1220_300_ysB=Eh~... That's a pity...
M6010_S0020_G0090_300_op=I wonder what Earth was like when humans were there.
M6010_S0020_G0100_300_op=Well, I haven't been to the current Earth either though.
M6010_S0020_G0110_300_op=You can go to the Hangar from the side elevator.
M6010_S0020_G0120_300_op=You've remembered by now? Well, sorry about that.
M6010_S0020_G0130_300_opb=Hmmm... This is troubling~
M6010_S0020_G0140_300_opa=Can't seem to find it...
M6010_S0020_G0150_300_opa=...Hm? What's the problem, you ask?
M6010_S0020_G0160_300_opa=Actually, one of the surface squadron members seems to have lost a Pod in the Flooded City.
M6010_S0020_G0170_300_opb=We tried tracing the distress sound, but we can't find it~
M6010_S0020_G0180_300_opa=It seems they searched most of the ground in that area...
M6010_S0020_G0190_300_opb=If you find it, won't you please protect it?\nBeing all alone is pitiful.
M6010_S0020_G0200_300_opa=Counting on you.
M6010_S0020_G0850_300_ys=...It's you guys, right? Who received the peace offer from the Machine Lifeforms.\nHow is it? Do they seem trustworthy?
M6010_S0020_G0860_300_ys=Sorry, maybe because the war has continued for so long... I just can't trust them.
M6010_S0020_G0870_300_ys=Certainly, if peace is concluded, the surface will become peaceful too, but...
M6010_S0020_G0880_300_op=If peace is concluded, the surface will become peaceful for the time being.
M6010_S0020_G0890_300_op=But that peace is fraught with danger...where a slight conflict could immediately develop into strife.
M6010_S0020_G0900_300_op=Even so, the combat squadron won't have to fight enemies head-on like now.\nI think the peace treaty is worth enough for that alone.
M6010_S0020_G0910_300_op=Oh, it's you.\nDid you try the new product?
M6010_S0020_G0920_300_op=If not yet, please try it!
M6010_S0020_G0930_300_op=If our invention can suppress damage even a little, there is nothing happier than that.
M6010_S0020_G0940_300_op=Manufacturing bodies costs money, after all!
M6010_S0020_G1080_300_ysA=Uugh... I feel sick...
M6010_S0020_G1090_300_ysB=You guys, I heard you received a peace offer from the Machine Lifeforms.
M6010_S0020_G1100_300_ysB=I have no idea what those guys are thinking... Why now...
M6010_S0020_G1110_300_ysA=Peace, if concluded... I don't...have to fly the sky...anymore...?
M6010_S0020_G1120_300_ysB=...Well, the number of times will decrease from now.
M6010_S0020_G1130_300_ysB=If we had been able to talk to them sooner, could we have reduced the sacrifices?
M6010_S0020_G1140_300_ysB=I know hypothetical talk is meaningless, but I can't help thinking that.
M6010_S0020_G1150_300_ysB=Are you the ones who said you spoke with Machine Lifeforms?
M6010_S0020_G1160_300_op=...Surely, you aren't believing in those savage bunches with exposed metal?
M6010_S0020_G1170_300_op=They are the enemies of humanity, and hateful enemies who killed our brethren.\nIt is unbearable that they are swaggering about the surface as if they own it even now.
M6010_S0020_G1180_300_ysA=Since the stalemate has continued for a while, they probably think we'll swallow their conditions.
M6010_S0020_G1190_300_ysB=In the end, I wonder where their boss is hiding.
M6010_S0020_G1200_300_ysB=Since it's all over once we defeat the Aliens, they should just come out quickly.
M6010_S0020_G1210_300_ysA=We have the advantage now.
M6010_S0020_G1220_300_ysA=Let's destroy them like this and offer victory to humanity.
M6010_S0080_G0000_300_op=Surface squadron, this is Bunker.\nReceived the report.
M6010_S0080_G0010_300_op=Continue to work hard.
M6010_S0080_G0020_300_op=What? Do you need something?
M6010_S0080_G0030_300_op=Good work, how is your condition?
M6010_S0080_G0040_300_op=Resting a little is fine, but shouldn't you return to the mission soon?
M6010_S0080_G0050_300_op=Good work~\nAre you resting~?
M6010_S0080_G0060_300_op=If you rest too much and get scolded by the Commander, I don't know about it~
M6010_S0080_G0450_300_op=<<Hello, do you have any injuries?>>
M6010_S0080_G0460_300_op=<<I forwarded the previous report to Command. I will contact you with the next mission.>>
M6010_S0080_G0470_300_op=What's wrong? Are you injured somewhere?
M6010_S0080_G0480_300_op=If you're injured, you have to treat it properly, okay?\nPlease don't push yourself.
M6010_S0080_G0490_300_op=Good work.\nWhat is it, skipping work?
M6010_S0080_G0500_300_op=Don't skip work too much.\nI won't cover for you if you get scolded.
M6010_S0080_G0540_300_op=<<Surface squadron! Flight Units are expensive, so\nplease treat them carefully!!>>
M6010_S0080_G0550_300_op=I'm busy right now! Save it for later!
