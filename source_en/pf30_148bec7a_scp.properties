M4100_S0010_G0000_300_unknown=The YoRHa squadron was annihilated...\nAnd so, the Earth was transformed into a paradise for the robots...
M4100_S0020_G0000_300_unknown=The YoRHa squadron was forced into a disadvantage by Machine Lifeforms unleashing Super-Large-Scale Weapons.\nThe annihilation of the YoRHa squadron is likely only a matter of time. The path to humanity's glory has been severed.
M4100_S0030_G0000_300_unknown="I can no longer suppress my curiosity about the Machine Lifeforms. I will go independent and research them as I please." Leaving these words behind, 9S vanished.
M4100_S0040_G0000_300_unknown=Due to 2B and 9S abandoning their mission, the City Ruins and the Resistance Camp suffered a devastating blow.
M4100_S0040_G0010_300_unknown=The annihilation of the YoRHa squadron is likely only a matter of time.
M4100_S0050_G0000_300_unknown=After 2B left, 9S waited for her for several decades.\nBut 2B never appeared again.
M4100_S0060_G0000_300_unknown=2B suddenly threw a tantrum and wiped out all the Machine Lifeforms.\nPeace was never established with the androids...
M4100_S0070_G0000_300_unknown=Unable to suppress its curiosity, the android ate a horse mackerel.\nImmediately, its body fluids began to coagulate, and it could feel the muscles all over its body begin to seize up.
M4100_S0070_G0010_300_unknown=...It's certainly delicious. Understandable why humanity used it for food.\nAs its consciousness faded, that is what the android thought.
M4100_S0080_G0000_300_unknown=Sick of it all, 2B abandoned her mission and decided to go fishing at the coast then and there. That's it, I'll become a fisherman. A bright, beaming smile spread across 2B's face.
M4100_S0080_G0010_300_unknown=Ten years have passed since she fled the battlefield. 2B became a target hunted by both the Machine Lifeforms and the YoRHa assassination unit. However, she seems to be enjoying her life on the run.
M4100_S0090_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like going for a little walk.\nBy the time she was satisfied, Pascal's Village had long since perished.
M4100_S0100_G0000_300_unknown=A berserk android annihilated the village of non-hostile Machine Lifeforms.
M4100_S0100_G0010_300_unknown=Thus, the peaceful Machine Lifeforms were exterminated. It is said that from within the now-deserted village, the laughing voice of an android can occasionally be heard.
M4100_S0110_G0000_300_unknown=A portion of the YoRHa units abandoned the operation. As a result, the android army collapsed, and the surface became a paradise for the Machine Lifeforms.
M4100_S0110_G0010_300_unknown=The whereabouts of the escaped YoRHa units remain unknown to this day...
M4100_S0120_G0000_300_unknown=The virus had penetrated even 2B's central nervous system.\nHaving lost her reason, she wandered the ruins until her power finally ran out.
M4100_S0130_G0000_300_unknown=9S suddenly lost interest in 2B.\nThe reason is unknown, but regardless, he had lost interest in everything.
M4100_S0140_G0000_300_unknown=A2, struck by an idea, suddenly began destroying Machine Lifeforms.\nPascal could only watch her, dumbfounded.
M4100_S0150_G0000_300_unknown=Leaving the struggling Devola and Popola behind, 9S walked away.\nOf course, Devola and Popola died.
M4100_S0160_G0000_300_unknown=[DANGER] [HANDLE WITH CARE]\nThe OS Chip must never be removed. Removing it results in death.
M4100_S0170_G0000_300_unknown=Self-destructed in the Bunker. The Bunker collapsed due to a chain reaction of explosions.\nIt is said that its falling figure looked just like a shooting star.
M4100_S0170_G0010_300_unknown=Self-destruct carried out in the Bunker. The Commander, thrown out into space, stared into the void with a demonic expression...
M4100_S0180_G0000_300_unknown=For some reason, 9S aborted the hacking of the Tower and began cheering for the fighting Devola and Popola. Naturally, they were eventually overwhelmed by numbers, and the three were crushed to death.
M4100_S0200_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like going for a little walk.\nBy the time she was satisfied, 2B had been completely gnawed away by Machine Lifeforms and was gone.
M4100_S0210_G0000_300_unknown=The berserk Emils caused the fusion reactors to go out of control.\nThis Earth was no longer a planet where living things could dwell.
M4100_S0220_G0000_300_unknown=A2 destroyed Pascal. Afterward, due to Pascal's death, the village of Machine Lifeforms collapsed and went berserk, resulting in the annihilation of all androids on the surface.
