M1050_S0195_S0137_201_n02=Long live the King!
M1050_S0195_S0138_201_n02=This here is our country! It's the place we love!
M1050_S0210_G0000_001_a9s=2B! That's... an android!
M1050_S0210_G0010_001_a9s=And what's more... isn't that a YoRHa Type!?
M1050_S0210_G0020_011_pod042=Analysis: YoRHa Special Designation Unit confirmed. Recommendation: Destruction.
M1050_S0210_G0030_021_pod153=Analysis: YoRHa Special Designation Unit confirmed. Recommendation: Destruction.
M1050_S0210_G0040_001_a9s=Destruction? Why!?
M1050_S0210_G0050_001_a2b=9S... Let's go.
M1050_S0210_G0060_001_a9s=2B!!
M1050_S0210_G0070_001_a2=
M1050_S0210_G0080_001_cmd=Bunker to 2B, 9S.
M1050_S0210_G0090_001_cmd=We have detected the black box signal of the wanted fugitive "A2" at your location.
M1050_S0210_G0100_001_cmd=The unit before you... is an enemy.
M1050_S0210_G0110_001_a2b=
M1050_S0210_G0120_001_a9s=But, she's...!
M1050_S0210_G0130_001_cmd=She's a deserter. She has destroyed multiple pursuit units!
M1050_S0210_G0140_001_cmd=If you hesitate, you'll be killed!
M1050_S0230_G0000_001_a9s=Bunker, this is 9S. Connect me to the Commander, please.
M1050_S0230_G0001_001_a9s=2B, let's go after her!
M1050_S0230_G0003_001_a2b=She got away...
M1050_S0230_G0010_001_op210=Bunker, roger. Connecting to the Commander.
M1050_S0230_G0020_001_a9s=Commander. The destruction of target A2... has failed.
M1050_S0230_G0020_300__pod042=Proposal: Pursue the deserter "A2."
M1050_S0230_G0030_001_cmd=I see...
M1050_S0230_G0030_300_a9s=Dammit... She got away.
M1050_S0230_G0040_001_cmd=But I'm glad that you're both safe.
M1050_S0230_G0050_001_cmd=That is an extremely dangerous individual.
M1050_S0230_G0050_300_a9s=That looks like the gate Pascal opened for us.
M1050_S0230_G0060_001_cmd=It would be best not to approach her carelessly.
M1050_S0230_G0060_300_n02=WE. HAVE. BEEN. WAITING.
M1050_S0230_G0070_001_a9s=Commander... about the desertion. What exactly happened...?
M1050_S0230_G0070_300_n02=WE. HEARD. THE. STORY. FROM. PASCAL.
M1050_S0230_G0080_001_cmd=...
M1050_S0230_G0080_300_n02=NOW. WE. SHALL. OPEN. THE. GATE.
M1050_S0230_G0090_001_cmd=That information is classified. I cannot tell you.
M1050_S0230_G0090_300_n02=PLEASE. PASS. THROUGH.
M1050_S0230_G0100_001_a9s=...I see.
M1050_S0230_G0100_300_n02=I. SHALL. CONTINUE. THE. WATCH. HERE.
M1050_S0230_G0110_001_a9s=...2B.
M1050_S0230_G0120_001_a2b=What is it?
M1050_S0230_G0130_001_a9s=Let's go ask Pascal about A2.
M1050_S0230_G0140_001_a9s=He might know something...
M1050_S0230_G0150_001_a2b=...Understood.
M1050_S0230_G0160_001_a9s=Pascal... this is 9S.
M1050_S0230_G0170_001_pascal=Oh, are you unharmed?
M1050_S0230_G0180_001_a9s=Yeah... More importantly, there's something I want to ask you.
M1050_S0230_G0190_001_pascal=Something you want to ask? What might that be?
M1050_S0230_G0200_001_a9s=Not over comms. We'll come and ask you in person.
M1050_S0230_G0210_001_pascal=...Understood.
M1050_S0230_G0220_001_pascal=I will open the gate that was blocking enemy entry.
M1050_S0230_G0230_001_pascal=I'll arrange it so you can enter the village from there.
