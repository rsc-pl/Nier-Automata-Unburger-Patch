M5650_S0020_G0000_300_resiman=You'll go get it for me?
M5650_S0020_G0010_300_sele=Guess I have no choice.
M5650_S0020_G0020_300_sele=I'm busy right now.
M5650_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=I'm counting on you!
M5650_S0020_G0040_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside for a change of pace.
M5650_S0020_G0050_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside for a change of pace.
M5650_S0020_G0051_300_pod042=Proposal: Go outside and deliver the cargo to the client.
M5650_S0020_G0052_300_pod153=Proposal: Go outside and deliver the cargo to the client.
M5650_S0020_G0060_300_sele=Go outside.
M5650_S0020_G0070_300_sele=Continue working.
M5651_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, it's you. Long time no see...
M5651_S0010_G0010_001_resiman=Actually, I can't get the "Cargo for Transport" out again... um...
M5651_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=Please! Help me!
M5651_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=You're... a former YoRHa member?
M5651_S0010_G0040_001_resiman=Perfect timing. Actually, the "Cargo for Transport" is too heavy and I can't get it out... um...
M5651_S0010_G0050_001_resiman=Please! Help me!
M5651_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Help.
M5651_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Refuse.
M5651_S0010_G0080_001_resiman=Ugh... I see... My senpai's going to get mad at me again...
M5651_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=Ah! Are you possibly in the mood to go get the cargo now?!
M5651_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=Huh! Really?!
M5651_S0010_G0110_001_resiman=Man, that's a huge help... That senpai is really scary...
M5651_S0010_G0120_001_resiman=It would be a huge help if you could gather the "Cargo for Transport."
M5651_S0020_G0000_001_pod153=Marking objects believed to be "Cargo for Transport."
M5651_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Marking objects believed to be "Cargo for Transport."
M5651_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=With that, I've finished gathering all the cargo...
M5651_S0020_G0050_001_a2=With that, I've finished gathering all the cargo...
M5651_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=Ah, you gathered the cargo. Thank you! That was a huge help!
M5651_S0030_G0010_001_resiman=The warehouse was a mess, right? ...Actually, my senpai dropped by a while ago and made a mess of things.
M5651_S0030_G0020_001_resiman=I'm always the one who has to clean up after her...
M5651_S0030_G0030_001_resiman=Ah, this is for you. Please accept it.
