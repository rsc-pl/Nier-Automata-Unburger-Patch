M1020_S0010_G0120_001_resi=It's been getting dangerous around here lately...
M1020_S0010_G0130_001_resi=Just the other day, some of our comrades were attacked by the enemy.
M1020_S0010_G0140_001_resi=I'm worried about what's going to happen...
M1020_S0010_G0150_001_resi=The sand makes it easy to lose your footing, so be careful.
M1020_S0010_G0160_001_resi=Ah, so you're the YoRHa. I've heard about you.
M1020_S0010_G0170_001_resi=Our comrades are waiting in the rocky area up ahead, so head that way.
M1020_S0010_G0180_001_resi=But be warned, there are no supply points in the Desert Zone.
M1020_S0010_G0190_001_resi=If you need anything, you'd be wise to trade for it here.
M1020_S0010_G0250_001_resi=...Try not to push yourselves too hard.
M1020_S0010_G0260_001_resi=Ah, it's you two.
M1020_S0010_G0270_001_resi=It's a huge help that we can get materials from the desert now.
M1020_S0010_G0280_001_resi=It's not much, but please take this as a token of our thanks.
M1020_S0010_G0290_001_resi=If you ever need anything, stop on by.
M1020_S0010_G0300_001_resi=Care to trade for anything?
M1020_S0010_G0310_001_resi=It was a huge help getting those desert machines taken care of...
M1020_S0010_G0320_001_resi=Thank you.
M5150_S0030_G0080_001_ys=Ah, this medicine? ...When I take it, I just feel so light and carefree...\nHeheh... Heheheh...
M5150_S0030_G0090_001_ys=Drugs...? This stuff is wild... It's so much fun... I can't stop fighting.
M5150_S0030_G0100_001_pod042=Analysis: Side effects resulting from pharmacological ingestion.
M5150_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0120_001_a2b=No... are things really so bad that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5150_S0030_G0130_001_pod153=Analysis: Side effects resulting from pharmacological ingestion.
M5150_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=No... are things really so bad that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5150_S0030_G0160_001_pod042=Analysis: Side effects resulting from pharmacological ingestion.
M5150_S0030_G0170_001_a2=Drug abuse...
M5150_S0030_G0180_001_a2=No... are things really so bad that they have to rely on drugs...?
M5590_S0050_G0360_001_resistance=I wonder what kind of civilization used to be... in this place.
M6030_S0010_G0000_300_ys=We are investigating this area.
M6030_S0010_G0010_300_ys=It's a tough mission for both of us, but... let's do our best.
M6030_S0010_G0020_300_ys=This oil field appears to be a viable resource.
M6030_S0010_G0030_300_ys=If we can suppress the Machine Lifeform activity in the Desert Zone,\nwe'll be able to transport it safely.
M6030_S0010_G0040_300_ys=Even if it's tedious work, if it can save even one more of our comrades...
M6030_S0010_G0050_300_ys=You! What are you doing here?\nWhat about your mission?
M6030_S0010_G0060_300_ys=Me? ...I got lost!\nAhaha! Sorry to startle you.
M6030_S0010_G0070_300_ys=Only in this area does fresh water well up and allow plants to grow.
M6030_S0010_G0080_300_ys=It's a difficult region for even an android to operate in.\nNature really is amazing, isn't it?
M6030_S0010_G0090_300_ys=I'm going to investigate here a little longer.\nKeep it a secret from the Commander, okay?
M6030_S0010_G0100_300_robowoman=Oh my! Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0110_300_robowoman=How are you today?
M6030_S0010_G0120_300_n02=What you come for!
M6030_S0010_G0130_300_n02=Outsider!
M6030_S0010_G0140_300_n02=Weird one.
M6030_S0010_G0150_300_n02=You come from outside.
M6030_S0010_G0160_300_sp=Ah, you two. It's a relief we can get desert materials now.
M6030_S0010_G0170_300_sp=Care to trade for anything?
M6030_S0010_G0180_300_sp=Stop by again sometime.
M6030_S0010_G0190_300_ys=We're on a mission to send resources from this area to the Bunker.
M6030_S0010_G0200_300_ys=The environment here is harsh for androids to operate in, but...
M6030_S0010_G0210_300_ys=...No, my apologies. Let's focus on the mission.
M6030_S0010_G0220_300_ys=I heard you defeated the Machine Lifeforms!
M6030_S0010_G0230_300_ys=That's amazing! You have my respect...
M6030_S0010_G0240_300_ys=Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0250_300_ys=I requested this investigation mission from the Commander.\nI was so happy, because it's quiet and safe here.
M6030_S0010_G0260_300_ys=I wish the other areas could be like this one.
M6030_S0010_G0261_300_js=Thanks for helping with my research.
M6030_S0010_G0262_300_js=I'm grateful to you.
M6030_S0010_G0263_300_js=If you need anything, I'll lend a hand.
M6030_S0010_G0270_300_sp=Thanks to you two, I'm starting to get a decent stock of items.
M6030_S0010_G0280_300_sp=Care to trade for anything?
M6030_S0010_G0290_300_sp=Stop by again.
M6030_S0010_G0300_300_ys=Our progress is falling behind schedule.
M6030_S0010_G0310_300_ys=Command is breathing down my neck, too. I have to do something...
M6030_S0010_G0320_300_ys=What should I do...
M6030_S0010_G0330_300_ys=Good work out there! I check your activity logs religiously!
M6030_S0010_G0340_300_ys=I'll do my best on my own mission, too!
M6030_S0010_G0350_300_ys=Hello!
M6030_S0010_G0360_300_ys=The other day, a flock of birds came here to rest their wings.\nI wonder if they know a way through the storm.
M6030_S0010_G0370_300_ys=When I'm here, I feel like time flows more slowly.
M6030_S0010_G0380_300_ys=If you have the time, why don't you do some fishing?
M6030_S0010_G0381_300_js=I'm grateful to you.
M6030_S0010_G0382_300_js=Lately, something's been bothering me a bit...
M6030_S0010_G0383_300_js=Maybe I'll investigate it a little.
M6030_S0010_G0390_300_sp=So you made it.\nThis area was lucky to get off with little damage, but who knows what'll happen from now on.
M6030_S0010_G0400_300_sp=Care to trade for anything?
M6030_S0010_G0410_300_sp=See you... around.
M6030_S0010_G0420_300_ys=Drugs...? This stuff is wild... It's so much fun... I can't stop fighting.
M6030_S0010_G0430_300_ys=Mission? ...I don't care anymore. ...Just leave me alone.
M6030_S0010_G0440_300_ys=Hah... Hah...
M6030_S0010_G0450_300_ys=Ah, drugs? ...I'm not recommending them, but if you absolutely insist...
M6030_S0010_G0460_300_ys=You want some of this drug... don't you?
M6030_S0010_G0470_300_ys=Thank you... With this... Heheheheh...
M6030_S0010_G0480_300_ys=...
M6031_S0011_G0411_300_js=So the Bunker fell...
M6032_S0012_G0412_300_js=White... Dammit!
M6033_S0013_G0413_300_js=...Sorry. I had an acquaintance on the Bunker.
M6033_S0013_G0414_300_js=You're... A2...
M6033_S0013_G0415_300_js=...No, it's nothing. Be careful.
M6033_S0013_G0416_300_js=I'm not really in the mood to talk right now...
