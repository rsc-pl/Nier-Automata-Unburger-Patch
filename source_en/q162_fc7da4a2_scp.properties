M5162_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=There are Machine Lifeforms...
M5162_S0010_G0060_001_pod042=Confirmed jamming radio waves from some enemy individuals.
M5162_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=Jamming?

M5162_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=The cause of the Access Point malfunction was Machine Lifeforms emitting jamming radio waves.
M5162_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=...Does that mean they understand that facility is our communication terminal?
M5162_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=That's not all. Even though they understand it is a communication terminal, they did not destroy the Access Point.
