M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=We won't fight! We won't fight!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill us! Don't kill us!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We haven't done anything bad...!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=Toys are fun!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Ugh... What should I do...
M6050_S0010_G0100_300_villager=This is our village. I am protecting the safety of the village.
M6050_S0010_G0110_300_villager=I wonder if it's time for the lookout shift change yet...
M6050_S0010_G0120_300_villager=Welcome to our village...
M6050_S0010_G0130_300_villager=Take your time...
M6050_S0010_G0140_300_kj=Good of you to come. There are no ones who like conflict in this village, but we stock weapons just in case.
M6050_S0010_G0150_300_kj=If you're curious, will you take a look?
M6050_S0010_G0160_300_kj=You came again? Take your time.
M6050_S0010_G0170_300_kj=I was taught how to make them by the legendary swordsmith living in the forest.
M6050_S0010_G0180_300_kj=It would be nice if he came to the village too.
M6050_S0010_G0190_300_kj=I like peace, but I also like weapons... It's contradictory.
M6050_S0010_G0200_300_kj=Come visit again anytime.
M6050_S0010_G0210_300_sp=Welcome. Is there something you want?
M6050_S0010_G0220_300_sp=Please come again anytime. No need for hesitation.
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, Sartre-san...
M6050_S0010_G0240_300_villager=Where is the good part of Sartre... Do you understand?
M6050_S0010_G0250_300_villager=The charm of Sartre... I do not understand it.
M6050_S0010_G0260_300_villager=...Three-tiered belly, it's cool.
M6050_S0010_G0270_300_villager=Someday, I will increase the tiers of my belly too.
M6050_S0010_G0280_300_villager=I am keeping watch to see if any weird guys come to the village.
M6050_S0010_G0290_300_villager=Ahead of here is connected to the forest castle.
M6050_S0010_G0310_300_villager=This is a quiet and good place...
M6050_S0010_G0320_300_villager=Solitude is what makes people strong.
M6050_S0010_G0330_300_villager=Making time to be alone is an important thing, don't you think so too?
M6050_S0010_G0340_300_villager=Well, I am not a person though.
M6050_S0010_G0350_300_villager=...It's not that I don't have friends.
M6050_S0010_G0360_300_pascal=There is no hostility in those who are here. They are all gentle villagers.
M6050_S0010_G0370_300_pascal=Watching the children play energetically is my daily routine.
M6050_S0010_G0380_300_villager=Uncle Pascal! Let's play!
M6050_S0010_G0390_300_villager=Play with us! ...Play!
M6050_S0010_G0400_300_villager=Understood, in exchange, you must do your studies properly too.
M6050_S0010_G0410_300_villager=Can you promise?
M6050_S0010_G0420_300_villager=Yeah, I'll study! Later!
M6050_S0010_G0430_300_villager=Later, I'll do it later!
M6050_S0010_G0440_300_villager=What shall we play...
M6050_S0010_G0450_300_villager=I didn't think about it.
M6050_S0010_G0460_300_villager=Playing is also part of studying.
M6050_S0010_G0470_300_villager=You think so too, right.
M6050_S0010_G0480_300_villager=I can play by myself already.
M6050_S0010_G0490_300_villager="Uncle Pascal" this, "Uncle Pascal" that... those guys are such kids.
M6050_S0010_G0500_300_villager=...What is it... Do you want to play with me?
M6050_S0010_G0510_300_villager=If you really insist... it's fine, you know?
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in us fighting.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=It is exactly as Sartre says.
M6050_S0010_G0570_300_villager=I'm what you call the indoor type.
M6050_S0010_G0580_300_villager=I like the scenery I view while lazing around at home.
M6050_S0010_G0590_300_villager=I love the outdoors to death.
M6050_S0010_G0600_300_villager=Flying in the forest while listening to the rustling of trees feels very good.
M6050_S0010_G0610_300_villager=Well, guys who can't fly probably wouldn't understand.
M6050_S0010_G0620_300_villager=The scenery viewed from the sky is the best.
M6050_S0010_G0630_300_villager=Hey, I like high places!
M6050_S0010_G0640_300_villager=do you like high places too? The view from here is wonderful!
M6050_S0010_G0650_300_villager=Uncle Pascal said it's no good because it's dangerous, but I want to try going to the forest castle visible over there.
M6050_S0010_G0660_300_villager=Uncle Pascal made a slide for us!
M6050_S0010_G0670_300_villager=This is addictive! It's going to become a habit!
M6050_S0010_G0680_300_villager=This is the slide I hear rumors about, is it.
M6050_S0010_G0690_300_villager=It is extremely interesting...
M6050_S0010_G0700_300_villager=I will observe the situation a little more before sliding.
M6050_S0010_G0710_300_villager=I-It's not that I'm scared!
M6050_S0010_G0780_300_villager=What to do today?
M6050_S0010_G0790_300_villager=Tag!
M6050_S0010_G0800_300_villager=Ummm... Ummm, Jump Rope!
M6050_S0010_G0810_300_villager=Jump Rope? I'll do that!
M6050_S0010_G0820_300_villager=But, is my leg length... enough?
M6050_S0010_G0830_300_villager=......
M6050_S0010_G0840_300_villager=...Life is tough.
M6050_S0010_G0850_300_villager=I guess it's Tag after all...
M6050_S0010_G0860_300_villager=I want to do... Jump Rope.
M6050_S0010_G0870_300_villager=My body is big, but my spirit is very small...
M6050_S0010_G0880_300_villager=Please don't bully me?
M6050_S0010_G0881_300_villager=I want to become big like that guy too.
M6050_S0010_G0882_300_villager=If only I had a bigger body... don't you think so?
M6050_S0010_G0883_300_villager=More... Grant me more mighty power...
M6050_S0010_G0884_300_villager=If I only had a giant body, even though I could destroy everything...
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is terrible, terrible.
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village.
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. It's nice weather today too, isn't it.
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=If you have any business, please say so.
M6050_S0010_G3030_300_villager=Today, take me to the top of the village, in front of the forest castle, and to Uncle Pascal's place!
M6050_S0010_G3040_300_villager=After that, the village entrance place, and the bridge heading to the amusement park!
M6050_S0010_G3050_300_villager=This guy, he can't climb to high places, so I carry him. My arms get tired because I carry him and play every day.
M6050_S0010_G3060_300_villager=Next time, I'll have Uncle Pascal teach him the word "restraint".
