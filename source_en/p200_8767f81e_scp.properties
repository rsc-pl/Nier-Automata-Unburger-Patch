M1080_S0090_G0010_201_a9s=...
M1080_S0090_G0020_201_a9s=Those words just now... They're the ones I heard on the Lunar Server.
M1080_S0090_G0030_201_a9s=Why...?
M1080_S0090_G0040_201_pod153=Report: Enemy Large-Scale Weapon has been destroyed by 2B.
M1080_S0090_G0050_201_a9s=Ah... right.
M1080_S0090_G0060_201_a9s=Understood.
M1080_S0090_G0070_201_cmd=9S...
M1080_S0090_G0080_201_a9s=Commander?
M1080_S0090_G0090_201_cmd=...My apologies, but I need you to come to the Command Center.
M1080_S0090_G0100_201_a9s=...Roger that.
M1080_S0800_G0000_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0800_G0010_201_cmd=...We found traces of you accessing the Main Server.
M1080_S0800_G0020_201_a9s=...I have something I want to ask you about that, Commander.
M1080_S0800_G0030_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0800_G0040_201_a9s=Within the records for Project YoRHa, there were establishment records for the Council of Humanity on the Moon.
M1080_S0800_G0050_201_a9s=If that's right, the order is reversed.
M1080_S0800_G0060_201_a9s=It's almost as if... we, the YoRHa forces, created the Council of Humanity...
M1080_S0800_G0070_201_cmd=.........
M1080_S0800_G0080_201_cmd=...That is correct.
M1080_S0800_G0090_201_cmd=We were the ones who set up the Council of Humanity server on the Moon.
M1080_S0800_G0100_201_a9s=Then...
M1080_S0800_G0110_201_cmd=Humanity is no more.
M1080_S0800_G0120_201_a9s=!!
M1080_S0800_G0130_201_cmd=To be precise, humanity never went to the moon.
M1080_S0800_G0140_201_cmd=The communications from the moon are nothing more than a dummy program.
M1080_S0800_G0150_201_cmd=All that remains on the moon is a small amount of humanity's genetic information.
M1080_S0800_G0160_201_a9s=Why... Why would you do that?
M1080_S0800_G0170_201_cmd=...By the time the aliens attacked, humanity had already perished.
M1080_S0800_G0180_201_cmd=All of the records are preserved on this chip.
M1080_S0800_G0190_201_cmd=If you are interested, you should take a look.
M1080_S0800_G0200_201_a9s=Why are you... giving this to me?
M1080_S0800_G0210_201_cmd=...
M1080_S0850_H0000_201_cmd=No one can fight without a reason.
M1080_S0850_H0010_201_cmd=We require a God worth dedicating our lives to.
