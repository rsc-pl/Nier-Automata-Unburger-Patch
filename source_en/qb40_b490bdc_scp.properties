M6010_S0010_G0090_300_op=No matter how much I look at Earth, I never get tired of it...
M6010_S0010_G0100_300_op=You can get to the Hangar from the elevator on the side, you know?
M6010_S0010_G0110_300_op=I hope the day we can return to Earth comes soon... together with humanity.
M6010_S0010_G0120_300_opa=Oh, hello there.
M6010_S0010_G0130_300_opa=You two are the talk of the town.
M6010_S0010_G0140_300_opb=Blowing up a huge target with a Black Box reaction, that's amazing~!
M6010_S0010_G0150_300_opa=Don't get too reckless and actually die on us, okay?
M6010_S0010_G0160_300_opb=We'll take good care of your data, so be sure to upload it frequently~
M6010_S0010_G0170_300_opa=If you want to go to the Command Room, head to the left.
M6010_S0010_G0180_300_opb=The Server Management Room is to the right~!
M6010_S0010_G0190_300_opa=Take care.
M6010_S0010_G0200_300_opb=See you later~!
M6010_S0010_G0840_300_op=Hello.
M6010_S0010_G0850_300_ys=We were just talking about the plants and animals we saw on the surface. Operators seem to love collecting data.
M6010_S0010_G0860_300_op=I'm so jealous of the combat units. If I were allowed, I'd go down there myself to collect data...
M6010_S0010_G0870_300_ys=If I could get permission, I'd take you. But I suppose that would be difficult.
M6010_S0010_G0880_300_op=It's fun to hear about all the different things on Earth, but what makes me happiest is seeing everyone return safely.
M6010_S0010_G0890_300_op=So you two shouldn't make us worry, either. Got it?
M6010_S0010_G0900_300_op=Hey, hello. Are you using the Recovery Medicine?
M6010_S0010_G0910_300_op=It's the pride of our Technological Development Department. You can buy it from this monitor in your private room, so please make use of it.
M6010_S0010_G0920_300_op=Hmm? Need something? ...The product lineup is too small, you say?
M6010_S0010_G0930_300_op=Can't be helped, the Bunker has limited supplies. We're working hard on development now, so just wait a bit.
M6010_S0010_G1060_300_ysA=...Ugh... I feel sick...
M6010_S0010_G1070_300_ysB=This one's equilibrium organs are shot. Despite being an android, she gets motion sickness.
M6010_S0010_G1080_300_ysB=We've tried repairing her many times, but it doesn't seem to help. Maybe it's become a habit?
M6010_S0010_G1090_300_ysB=You guys be careful, too.
M6010_S0010_G1100_300_ysB=You okay? Think you can head back?
M6010_S0010_G1110_300_ysA=............I can't...
M6010_S0010_G1120_300_ysB=...Maybe I'll put in a request for you so you don't have to use the Flight Units.
M6010_S0010_G1130_300_ysA=Good work. Heading out now?
M6010_S0010_G1140_300_ysB=Lucky you, I still want to be flying.
M6010_S0010_G1150_300_op=Flight Units are expensive, so I won't permit any wasteful use, understand?
M6010_S0010_G1160_300_op=The combat units are rough enough with them as it is. You scratched the fuselage just the other day, didn't you?
M6010_S0010_G1170_300_op=Who do you think has to clean up the paint you scrape off? Ruining such a beautiful craft, that's why you're always...
M6010_S0010_G1180_300_ysA=Stop! It was our fault, so that's enough, alright?
M6010_S0010_G1190_300_ysB=If only we could just get wings and jets attached to our bodies. Should I ask the Development Department?
M6010_S0010_G1200_300_op=That's a great idea! The Flight Units wouldn't get damaged either.
M6010_S0010_G1210_300_ysA=I tried asking before, but they rejected it. Said the body couldn't handle it, or the cost was too high.
M6010_S0010_G1220_300_ysB=Aww... That's too bad...
M6010_S0020_G0090_300_op=I wonder what Earth was like when humans were still around.
M6010_S0020_G0100_300_op=Though, I've never been to the Earth of today, either.
M6010_S0020_G0110_300_op=You can get to the Hangar from the side elevator.
M6010_S0020_G0120_300_op=You've remembered by now? My bad.
M6010_S0020_G0130_300_opb=Hmmm... This is a problem~
M6010_S0020_G0140_300_opa=We just can't seem to find it...
M6010_S0020_G0150_300_opa=...Hm? Is something wrong, you ask?
M6010_S0020_G0160_300_opa=Actually, one of the surface units seems to have lost a Pod in the Flooded City.
M6010_S0020_G0170_300_opb=We tried to trace the distress signal, but we can't find it~
M6010_S0020_G0180_300_opa=It seems like they've already searched most of the ground in that area...
M6010_S0020_G0190_300_opb=If you find it, would you please look after it? It's pitiful for it to be all alone.
M6010_S0020_G0200_300_opa=We're counting on you.
M6010_S0020_G0850_300_ys=...It was you two, wasn't it? The ones who got the peace offer from the Machine Lifeforms. How'd it go? They seem trustworthy?
M6010_S0020_G0860_300_ys=Sorry, maybe it's because this war has dragged on for so long... but I just can't bring myself to trust them.
M6010_S0020_G0870_300_ys=Sure, if a treaty is signed, the surface will probably be peaceful, but...
M6010_S0020_G0880_300_op=If a peace treaty is signed, the surface will become peaceful, for the time being.
M6010_S0020_G0890_300_op=But that peace would be fraught with danger... even a small clash could immediately escalate back into conflict.
M6010_S0020_G0900_300_op=Still, the combat units wouldn't have to fight enemies head-on like they do now. For that reason alone, I believe the treaty is worthwhile.
M6010_S0020_G0910_300_op=Oh, it's you. Have you tried the new product?
M6010_S0020_G0920_300_op=If not, you should!
M6010_S0020_G0930_300_op=If our inventions can reduce casualties even a little, there is nothing that would make me happier.
M6010_S0020_G0940_300_op=Manufacturing bodies is expensive, after all!
M6010_S0020_G1080_300_ysA=Ugh... I feel sick...
M6010_S0020_G1090_300_ysB=I heard you guys received a peace offer from the Machine Lifeforms.
M6010_S0020_G1100_300_ysB=I have no idea what those things are thinking... Why now, of all times...?
M6010_S0020_G1110_300_ysA=Peace... if that happens... I won't... have to fly anymore...?
M6010_S0020_G1120_300_ysB=...Well, the number of flights would probably go down.
M6010_S0020_G1130_300_ysB=If we had been able to talk to them sooner, could we have reduced the number of sacrifices?
M6010_S0020_G1140_300_ysB=I know it's pointless to talk about "what ifs," but I can't help but think it.
M6010_S0020_G1150_300_ysB=You're the ones who spoke with the Machine Lifeforms?
M6010_S0020_G1160_300_op=...Surely you don't actually believe those savage, metal-plated brutes?
M6010_S0020_G1170_300_op=They are the enemies of humanity, and the hateful foe that killed our brethren. I can't stand that they're still swaggering around the surface as if they own it.
M6010_S0020_G1180_300_ysA=Since we've been in a stalemate for a while, they probably think we'll accept their terms.
M6010_S0020_G1190_300_ysB=In the end, I wonder where their leader is hiding.
M6010_S0020_G1200_300_ysB=It would all be over once we defeat the Aliens, so they should just come out already.
M6010_S0020_G1210_300_ysA=We have the advantage now.
M6010_S0020_G1220_300_ysA=Let's exterminate them as planned and offer victory to humanity.
M6010_S0080_G0000_300_op=Surface unit, this is the Bunker. We've received your report.
M6010_S0080_G0010_300_op=Continue to carry out your duties.
M6010_S0080_G0020_300_op=What is it? Do you need something?
M6010_S0080_G0030_300_op=Good work. How are you holding up?
M6010_S0080_G0040_300_op=It's fine to rest a little, but shouldn't you be getting back to your mission soon?
M6010_S0080_G0050_300_op=Good work~! Are you on break~?
M6010_S0080_G0060_300_op=If you rest too long and the Commander gets mad, don't come crying to me~!
M6010_S0080_G0450_300_op=<<Hello, are you injured?>>
M6010_S0080_G0460_300_op=<<I've forwarded your report to Command. I will contact you with your next mission.>>
M6010_S0080_G0470_300_op=What's wrong? Are you hurt?
M6010_S0080_G0480_300_op=If you're injured, you have to get proper treatment, okay? Don't push yourself.
M6010_S0080_G0490_300_op=Good work. What, slacking off?
M6010_S0080_G0500_300_op=Don't slack off too much. It's not my problem if you get yelled at.
M6010_S0080_G0540_300_op=<<Surface unit! Flight Units are expensive, so please handle them with care!>>
M6010_S0080_G0550_300_op=I'm busy right now! Later!
