M5096_S0010_H0000_001_telo=Deserving of Life
M5096_S0010_H0010_001_telo=I found someone I loved
M5096_S0010_H0020_001_telo=We certainly touched each other
M5096_S0010_H0030_001_telo=Soil rather than asphalt
M5096_S0010_H0040_001_telo=Human skin rather than steel
M5096_S0010_H0050_001_telo=If what we choose unconsciously
M5096_S0010_H0060_001_telo=Is warmth rather than coldness
M5096_S0010_H0070_001_telo=Then that dirty face
M5096_S0010_H0080_001_telo=Is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0090_001_telo=About those who abused us
M5096_S0010_H0100_001_telo=Calling us insolent
M5096_S0010_H0110_001_telo=We shall sing thoroughly
M5096_S0010_H0120_001_telo=Of their own insolence
M5096_S0010_H0130_001_telo=If a reason is needed
M5096_S0010_H0140_001_telo=To move forward
M5096_S0010_H0150_001_telo=Be it anger or whatever else
M5096_S0010_H0160_001_telo=It is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0170_001_telo=In order to evaporate the spilled tears
M5096_S0010_H0180_001_telo=For the sun-shining morning
M5096_S0010_H0190_001_telo=Without tiring
M5096_S0010_H0200_001_telo=Without learning
M5096_S0010_H0210_001_telo=I am waiting
M5096_S0010_H0220_001_telo=I am waiting
M5096_S0010_H0230_001_telo=From the day I wasted everything
M5096_S0010_H0240_001_telo=I was vigilantly envisioning
M5096_S0010_H0250_001_telo=The morning where everything is rewarded
M5096_S0010_H0260_001_telo=Worthy of destroying the world
M5096_S0010_H0270_001_telo=That warmth
M5096_S0010_H0280_001_telo=We couldn't become a pair
M5096_S0010_H0290_001_telo=Loneliness and loneliness
M5096_S0010_H0300_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0310_001_telo=That habit of laughing when hurt
M5096_S0010_H0320_001_telo=Even though there was no need to be that sad
M5096_S0010_H0330_001_telo=If only I didn't have a heart
M5096_S0010_H0340_001_telo=I made a friend
M5096_S0010_H0350_001_telo=We shared ideals
M5096_S0010_H0360_001_telo=To the place we should head
M5096_S0010_H0370_001_telo=We shared even our stride
M5096_S0010_H0380_001_telo=That it's okay even if betrayed
M5096_S0010_H0390_001_telo=Like prostrating on the roadside
M5096_S0010_H0400_001_telo=The dawn of intoxication
M5096_S0010_H0410_001_telo=Is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0420_001_telo=I'm doing nothing but searching
M5096_S0010_H0430_001_telo=For replacements of something lost
M5096_S0010_H0440_001_telo=But not that
M5096_S0010_H0450_001_telo=I'm expecting a reversal play
M5096_S0010_H0460_001_telo=Where I can say even loss was the correct answer
M5096_S0010_H0470_001_telo=And that is never impossible
M5096_S0010_H0480_001_telo=Call even the footprints that ceased
M5096_S0010_H0490_001_telo=A journey
M5096_S0010_H0500_001_telo=Worthy of deceiving the world
M5096_S0010_H0510_001_telo=Ourselves until now
M5096_S0010_H0520_001_telo=Couldn't become one
M5096_S0010_H0530_001_telo=Lonely ones gathering
M5096_S0010_H0540_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0550_001_telo=Making a face like it's natural to hurt
M5096_S0010_H0560_001_telo=Even though there was no need to be that sad
M5096_S0010_H0570_001_telo=If only I didn't have a heart
M5096_S0010_H0580_001_telo=Because I wanted to protect what I loved
M5096_S0010_H0590_001_telo=The many things I destroyed
M5096_S0010_H0600_001_telo=The many wishes
M5096_S0010_H0610_001_telo=That were shattered all too easily
M5096_S0010_H0620_001_telo=Like crossing barefoot over those fragments
M5096_S0010_H0630_001_telo=Slipping on the next step
M5096_S0010_H0640_001_telo=The one step where you think
M5096_S0010_H0650_001_telo=It's okay to die there
M5096_S0010_H0660_001_telo=Simply, simply, that alone is deserving of life
M5096_S0010_H0670_001_telo=That loss
M5096_S0010_H0680_001_telo=Which was worth losing a heart for
M5096_S0010_H0690_001_telo=Joy and sadness
M5096_S0010_H0700_001_telo=Shouldn't have been a trade-off
M5096_S0010_H0710_001_telo=What happened along the way?
M5096_S0010_H0720_001_telo=That answer is the me of right now
M5096_S0010_H0730_001_telo=Something like hope
M5096_S0010_H0740_001_telo=Can be thrown away so very easily
M5096_S0010_H0750_001_telo=If only I didn't have a heart
M5096_S0010_H0760_001_telo=Light and Shadow
