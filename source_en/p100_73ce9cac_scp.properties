M1030_S0400_G0000_001_a2b=We have to save the other androids...
M1030_S0400_G0001_001_a2b=Thank you for your help.
M1030_S0400_G0002_001_a9s=Oh, you mean the hacking?
M1030_S0400_G0003_001_a9s=For us Scanner models, hacking is our specialty.
M1030_S0400_G0004_001_a9s=I can back you up anytime.
M1030_S0400_G0010_001_a9s=...It's no use. All of their circuits are fried.
M1030_S0400_G0020_001_a9s=It seems the enemy's system was the only thing keeping them alive...
M1030_S0400_G0030_001_a2b=...I see.
M1030_S0400_G0040_001_a9s=Hey... 2B.
M1030_S0400_G0050_001_a2b=What is it?
M1030_S0400_G0060_001_a9s=That Machine Lifeform was saying some strange things.
M1030_S0400_G0070_001_a9s=It was as if... it had emotions...
M1030_S0400_G0080_001_a2b=Machine Lifeforms do not have consciousness...
M1030_S0400_G0090_001_a2b=You're the one who said that, 9S.
M1030_S0400_G0100_001_a9s=...You're... right.
M1030_S0400_G0110_001_a2b=An enemy...!
M1030_S0400_G0120_001_n02=We are not enemies.
M1030_S0400_G0130_001_a9s=Huh...?
M1030_S0400_G0140_001_n02=You destroyed the broken Machine Lifeforms for us.
M1030_S0400_G0150_001_a9s=I never knew a Machine Lifeform could speak so clearly...
M1030_S0400_G0160_001_n02=We wish to thank you... Come to our village.
M1030_S0400_G0170_001_sele=Go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0180_001_sele=Do not go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0190_001_a9s=It might be a trap, but...
M1030_S0400_G0200_001_a9s=For now, should we go just to gather some information?
M1030_S0400_G0210_001_a9s=It's definitely suspicious...
M1030_S0400_G0220_001_a9s=But I've never seen a unit capable of this level of communication.
M1030_S0400_G0230_001_a9s=It might be worth checking out.
M1030_S0400_G0240_001_n02=We have no will to fight.
