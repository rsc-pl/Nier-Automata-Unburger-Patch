M5170_S0000_G0000_300_op60=Regarding the repair of the transporter, I'm counting on you.
M5170_S0010_G0000_001_op60=From Operator 6O to 2B-san. Can you hear me?
M5170_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=I hear you.
M5170_S0010_G0020_001_op60=It seems the transporter installed in the City Ruins has malfunctioned.
M5170_S0010_G0030_001_op60=At this rate there will be defects in surface activity,
M5170_S0010_G0040_001_op60=so please repair it whenever you have time.
M5170_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0010_G0060_001_op60=I have emailed the details. Please take care of it.
M5170_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=In the case that the transporter is unusable, significant defects will arise in data uploading etc.
M5170_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Recommendation: Immediate restoration of transporter.
M5170_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0020_G0030_001_pod042=Report: Hostile Machine Lifeforms in transporter vicinity. Jamming radio waves confirmed.
M5170_S0020_G0040_001_pod042=Deduction: Transporter defect is caused by enemy jamming radio waves.
M5170_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Recommendation: Prompt destruction of said Machine Lifeforms.
M5170_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=Is that, all of them.
M5170_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=Just in case, let's check the transporter main unit too.
M5170_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=It seems there is no problem with functionality.
M5170_S0030_G0021_001_pod042=Report: Transporter normal operation confirmed.
M5170_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=This is YoRHa Squadron 2B. Communicating to Bunker Operator 6O.
M5170_S0030_G0040_001_op60=Ah! 2B-san. Good work.
M5170_S0030_G0050_001_a2b=I restored the designated transporter. The cause was jamming radio waves from enemy Machine Lifeforms.
M5170_S0030_G0060_001_op60=Roger that! Thank you very much.
M5170_S0030_G0070_001_op60=I will share the information within Command!

M5170_S0030_G0100_001_op60=...But, it's nice~. 2B-san.
M5170_S0030_G0110_001_op60=N-no, I think combat missions are tough!
M5170_S0030_G0120_001_op60=Just, it's nice that you can see the beautiful scenery on the surface.
M5170_S0030_G0130_001_op60=I think, it would be nice if I could go down someday too.
M5170_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=...Is that so.
M5170_S0030_G0150_001_op60=I made useless small talk. I'm sorry!
M5170_S0030_G0160_001_op60=Well then, excuse me!
