M1050_S0005_G0000_001_op60=2B-san! This is Operator 6O.
M1050_S0005_G0001_001_a9s=We have to go back this way again...? What a pain.
M1050_S0005_G0002_001_a2b=No complaining, 9S.
M1050_S0005_G0003_001_a9s=Yes, ma'am.
M1050_S0005_G0010_001_op60=We've confirmed the deployment and activation of a transfer device in the City Ruins.
M1050_S0005_G0010_300_jackas=The other terminals should have transfer enabled now, too. Use 'em however you want.
M1050_S0005_G0011_300_jackas=So... you're pretty active all over the place, huh.
M1050_S0005_G0012_300_jackas=Hey, don't praise me. It's embarrassing.
M1050_S0005_G0020_001_op60=Other points are also being prepared.
M1050_S0005_G0030_001_a9s=So we can finally use the transfer devices.
M1050_S0005_G0040_001_a2b=Transfer device?
M1050_S0005_G0050_001_a9s=Yup. It's a device that transfers our self-data to a temporary body in the Bunker,\nwhile leaving our current bodies on the surface.
M1050_S0005_G0060_001_a9s=I'd heard about it from the tech guys, but it's finally ready for use.
M1050_S0005_G0070_001_a9s=I'll mark its location on the map.
M1050_S0005_G0071_001_jackas=Yo. How's it hangin'?
M1050_S0005_G0072_001_a2b=You're...
M1050_S0005_G0073_001_jackas=Your commander told me to, so I set up a new access point for ya.
M1050_S0005_G0074_001_jackas=I got the transfer device working, too.
M1050_S0005_G0075_001_a9s=Oh, thank you very much!
M1050_S0005_G0076_001_jackas=The Commander's an old acquaintance of mine, but man, she really works people to the bone, huh?
M1050_S0005_G0077_001_jackas=Complain to her for me next time you see her.
M1050_S0005_G0080_001_a2b=So this is the transfer device...
M1050_S0005_G0100_001_a9s=Still, with a transfer device...
M1050_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=It's really convenient. We won't have to take a Flight Unit back and forth\nbetween the Bunker and the surface every time.
M1050_S0005_G0120_001_a9s=Flight Units have high operational costs, and there's always the risk of being attacked, after all.
