M5121_S0010_G0000_001_ane=......
M5121_S0010_G0000_300_manager=Did you find the "Box that Plays a Sound When Opened"?
M5121_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=You seem troubled, Anemone-san.
M5121_S0010_G0010_300_manager=I'm sorry, could you come back later?
M5121_S0010_G0020_001_ane=Ah, work at the material storage has been stagnating recently.
M5121_S0010_G0020_300_manager=Everyone is fighting for their lives, so I can't just sit here complaining... I have to do my best...
M5121_S0010_G0030_001_ane=The manager in charge is usually a capable person, but...
M5121_S0010_G0040_001_ane=it seems they have something on their mind and can't focus on their work.
M5121_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I don't know what it is, but we have to do something before it affects everyone...
M5121_S0010_G0051_001_ane=The manager should be up the scaffolding assembled in the back of the camp.
M5121_S0010_G0052_001_ane=If you don't mind, please go listen to what they have to say.
M5121_S0010_G0060_001_manager=Sigh... It bothers me... It bothers me so much...
M5121_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Ummm, what is it that's bothering you?
M5121_S0010_G0080_001_manager=Hm...? Who are you?
M5121_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=We're from the YoRHa squadron.
M5121_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Anemone-san asked us to check on how things are going in the camp.
M5121_S0010_G0110_001_manager=I see...
M5121_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=So, what exactly is bothering you?
M5121_S0010_G0130_001_manager=Ah, actually, I can't stop thinking about the "Box that Plays a Sound When Opened" that my colleague had.
M5121_S0010_G0140_001_manager=When you open the box, a very beautiful melody plays.
M5121_S0010_G0150_001_manager=But no matter how I try, I can't remember how the melody goes after a certain point...
M5121_S0010_G0160_001_manager=Ah, it's driving me crazy!
M5121_S0010_G0170_001_manager=This would all be solved if they just came back sooner! Agh, honestly!
M5121_S0010_G0180_001_sele=Search for the "Box that Plays a Sound When Opened."
M5121_S0010_G0190_001_sele=Leave them alone, since they're being neurotic.
M5121_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=At this rate, it doesn't look like they'll get any work done...
M5121_S0010_G0210_001_a2b=A "Box that Plays a Sound When Opened," huh...
M5121_S0010_G0220_001_pod042=Deduction: The object is a music box. There is a high probability it is in a location where music plays.
M5121_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=In the vicinity, the Amusement Park is a candidate.
M5121_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=That's a very simplistic line of thought, but...
M5121_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=we don't have any other leads. Shall we go?
M5121_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=I wonder if this is the music box that the material storage manager was talking about?
M5121_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=It's pretty rusted, though.
M5121_S0010_G0280_001_a2b=A corpse...
M5121_S0010_G0290_001_a9s=Was the owner... this android?
M5121_S0010_G0300_001_a9s=Judging by the condition, it seems they died a long time ago.
M5121_S0010_G0310_001_a2b=...Anyway, let's deliver this box to the manager.
M5121_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Excuse us, is this the "Box that Plays a Sound When Opened" you were looking for?
M5121_S0030_G0010_001_manager=Yes! This is it, this is it! Where was it?
M5121_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=In the Amusement Park... near the remains of the android we believe to be the owner.
M5121_S0030_G0030_001_manager=Ah...
M5121_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Was that person...
M5121_S0030_G0050_001_manager=...
M5121_S0030_G0060_001_manager=...It's quite rusted, but if I repair it, I'm sure it will play again.
M5121_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Yes, of course.
M5121_S0030_G0080_001_manager=...Thank you for bringing me the box.
M5121_S0030_G0090_001_manager=Now I can finally get back to work!
M5121_S0030_G0100_001_manager=You two are free to come and go in the back area now, too.
