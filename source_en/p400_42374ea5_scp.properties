M5095_S0300_G0000_001_n02=Good grief. Organizing past records isn't easy either.
M5095_S0300_G0010_001_n02=Overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime every day, looks like I'm gonna die.
M5095_S0300_G0020_001_n02=Today's material is... Plato 1728 huh.
M5095_S0300_G0030_001_n02=Ah, that unit that went berserk...
M5095_S0300_G0100_001_n02=Phew, with this, record organizing here is complete.
M5095_S0300_G0110_001_n02=Umm, where was the next site again...
M5095_S0300_G0120_001_n02=Record organizing in the Server Room.
M5095_S0300_G0130_001_n02=Haa, the air in that room is stagnant so I hate it.
M5095_S0300_G0140_001_n02=Uhm, where was my terminal?
M5095_S0300_G0150_001_n02=Ah, it was this one.
M6150_S0145_G0000_001_juniorR=Ah, good work!!\nSenpai, after this, it was record organizing in the Server Room right!!
M6150_S0145_G0010_001_juniorR=The Server Room is just ahead past here!!
M6150_S0145_G0020_001_juniorR=I, was entrusted with Guide and Traffic Maintenance from today!\nNice to meet you!!
M6150_S0145_G0030_001_juniorR=Seems it's easy to get lost everywhere around here, and complaints came to the Management Department!\nBut, since I have been assigned, rest assured!!
