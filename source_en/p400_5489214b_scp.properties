M6150_S0010_G0020_001_dreamR2=Among my friends there was a guy who said he saw strange images as if he was active even though he was in sleep mode.
M6150_S0010_G0030_001_dreamR2=Seems like he was attracted to those images, and day by day if he had time, he started entering sleep mode state.
M6150_S0010_G0040_001_dreamR2=And finally after the great war the other day, he left saying he was going to the Other World, and hasn't woken up at all since then.
M6150_S0010_G0050_001_dreamR2=I wonder if the day will come when he activates again......
M6150_S0010_G0060_001_dreamR2=Because everyone lost many friends in the great war the other day, maybe he despaired of this world and chose to live in the Other World......
M6150_S0010_G0070_001_dreamR2=If this world becomes a peaceful world, will he wake up?
M6150_S0020_G0010_001_restR=Due to the great war the other day, both labor power and supplies are insufficient......
M6150_S0020_G0020_001_restR=20 hours labor a day is tough as expected......
M6150_S0030_G0020_001_terminalR=Good grief, in the large scale combat the other day, more than half the individuals in this district were lost.
M6150_S0030_G0030_001_terminalR=Even so, to think Plato 1728 possessed that kind of ability......
M6150_S0040_G0030_001_watchR=Everywhere is short on robots now so apparently there's no margin to repair the factory passage.
M6150_S0040_G0040_001_watchR=Until when must I fly here......
M6150_S0040_G0050_001_watchR=I'd rather attach a walking unit...... but, my pride as a flying type......
M6150_S0050_G0020_001_lookR=Ah, why did I not notice until now......
M6150_S0050_G0030_001_lookR=That building is exactly what we lifeless ones seek......
M6150_S0060_G0020_001_attractR=......Plato 1728...... You...... made it inside there right......
M6150_S0060_G0030_001_attractR=Now...... I...... will head there too......
M6150_S0070_G0030_001_frightenedR=T-to go berserk like that......
M6150_S0070_G0040_001_frightenedR=Impossible for me, no more battlefields ever again......
M6150_S0080_G0020_001_encourageR=This guy, he was promoted at the combat training the other day, and was deployed to a battlefield squad for the first time.
M6150_S0080_G0030_001_encourageR=But look, apparently he saw the berserk incident the other day right before his eyes, and ever since he came back he's been in this condition.
M6150_S0080_G0040_001_encourageR=I wasn't nearby so I don't know in detail, but to be terrified like this, just how did he go berserk?
M6150_S0090_G0010_001_audienceR=Hahaha, break! Break! Break! Break! Break!
M6150_S0100_G0010_001_audienceR=Goooo! Don't leave a single screw, tear them to pieces!!
M6150_S0110_G0010_001_audienceR=Heyyy! If you go easy I won't forgive you!!
M6150_S0120_G0030_001_questionR=Oh, good work.
M6150_S0120_G0040_001_questionR=There was a great war the other day right, I thought everyone would have learned their lesson about fighting with that. But apparently more guys than before are getting hooked on this place.
M6150_S0120_G0050_001_questionR=Everyone lost many comrades, and surely had scary thoughts, so why?
M6150_S0130_G0020_001_duskR=Because we lost a massive amount of individuals in the previous combat, right now we are running the production line in a huge hurry.
M6150_S0130_G0030_001_duskR=Broken then newly made, it's as if we're making them to be broken, I don't know......
M6150_S0140_G0020_001_badR=Plato 1728...... He was certainly a slow guy, but he was a good guy......
M6150_S0140_G0030_001_badR=Even if he was made a fool of, he didn't speak ill of other guys.
M6150_S0140_G0040_001_badR=And yet I...... Plato 1728 I'm sorry......
M6150_S0150_G0020_001_badR=Shit, that guy wasn't just worn out but to go berserk and break comrades too.
M6150_S0150_G0030_001_badR=Nothing but trouble, it would have been better to dispose of him sooner.
M6150_S0150_G0040_001_badR=He was an individual with no meaning to be manufactured.
M6150_S0155_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=For today's test I renewed my machine body to a movement specialized type.
M6150_S0155_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=Because in the battle before I dragged everyone down.\nI'll get promoted and become great, and I will protect everyone.
M6150_S0160_G0020_001_difficultR=Enter a combat squad and go to the battlefield, or do my best as a supply carrier and go down ladders, both are hell......
M6150_S0160_G0030_001_difficultR=Haa, ladders should just go extinct......
M6150_S0160_G0040_001_difficultR=I'd rather, by my own hand, remove ladders from this world......
M6150_S0160_G0050_001_difficultR=You are a comrade who understands this hardship right, won't you form an alliance together?
M6150_S0170_G0020_001_enthusiasticR=Unforgivable, Unforgivable cruel and atrocious androids!!\nThose guys, combat squads, non-combat squads regardless they tore them to pieces cruelly!
M6150_S0170_G0030_001_enthusiasticR=I will definitely complete this Giant Weapon, make those guys kneel, make them beg for their lives, and on top of that tear them to pieces!!
M6150_S0180_G0020_001_childR=I hope this child wakes up soon too!
M6150_S0180_G0030_001_childR=When this child wakes up, I'll become his friend!
M6150_S0190_G0010_001_lookR=Unfortunately development hit difficulties and didn't make it in time for the great war......
M6150_S0190_G0020_001_lookR=But, if only we complete this weapon, surely we can save the lives of many comrades.
M6150_S0200_G0020_001_restR=The busyness of the site just increases day by day......
M6150_S0200_G0030_001_restR=After allocating this much labor, on the day this weapon is destroyed by androids it's already despair......
M6150_S0210_G0020_001_restR=Have to work, have to work, have to work, have to work, have to work, have to work.
M6150_S0210_G0030_001_restR=Everyday is fulfilling so I'm happy......
M6150_S0220_G0010_001_duskR=Jump off, work, jump off, work, jump off, work, jump off, work, jump off, work, jump off, work, jump o......
M6150_S0230_G0010_001_terminalR=Don't call out during work...... This is work common sense......
M6150_S0240_G0010_001_terminalR=This goes here...... that goes there......\nWhy, why does it still bug...... Ugagagagaa.
M6150_S0250_G0010_001_terminalR=Why do bugs exist in this world I wonder?
M6150_S0250_G0020_001_terminalR=If I find the answer to this question, I can become God!
M6150_S0260_G0010_001_terminalR=Please search for the missing squad in the vicinity of the Forest Area.
M6150_S0260_G0020_001_terminalR=There are enemy reactions nearby too so please be sufficiently vigilant.
M6150_S0270_G0020_001_terminalR=In this great war too, a considerable scale of squads were annihilated by the YoRHa squad.
M6150_S0270_G0030_001_terminalR=When I think what if those guys are mass produced it's terrifying.
M6150_S0280_G0010_001_terminalR=To think production of the Giant Weapon would take this much trouble......
M6150_S0290_G0020_001_terminalR=Recently, the number of repair requests for lent out weapons is high......
M6150_S0290_G0030_001_terminalR=Hum, shall we make this month's goal "Let's treasure the weapons that protect our lives!!".
M6150_S0300_G0010_001_terminalR=........................................................................................................................
M6150_S0300_G0020_001_terminalR=Ah, sorry the terminal sound was too noisy so I cut the audio sensor.\nIt's quite recommended.
M6150_S0310_G0010_001_terminalR=Do we work to live, or do we live to work, recently I don't know.
M6150_S0310_G0020_001_terminalR=What do you think?
M6150_S0320_G0010_001_terminalR=Haa, I haven't gone home for 4 days already......
M6150_S0330_G0010_001_terminalR=Idle chatter is strictly prohibited......
M6150_S0340_G0010_001_terminalR=What on earth is there beyond continued working......
M6150_S0350_G0010_001_terminalR=In a place busy with Giant Weapon construction, Plato 1728's berserk incident, good grief I wish they wouldn't increase work.
M6150_S0360_G0060_001_terminalR=Yo, you're on information organization work here today too?\nMore importantly listen to me.
M6150_S0360_G0070_001_terminalR=Entering this month, massive amounts of complaint mails regarding labor environment are coming from employees......
M6150_S0360_G0080_001_terminalR=The complaint mails torment (Kuru-shimeru) me (Mail). Pupupu.
M6150_S0370_G0020_001_terminalR=I have already stopped thinking.\nI just work. Yes, I work. I am happy.
M6150_S0380_G0010_001_terminalR=This is 28th District Command Room, to ground squads.
M6150_S0380_G0020_001_terminalR=Currently, the number of combat squads is insufficient. We cannot perform member replenishment for the present. Each squad please cooperate and execute missions. Communication End.
M6150_S0390_G0020_001_terminalR=13th Squad, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0030_001_terminalR=Contact with 14th Squad has ceased. Please rush to the site immediately.
M6150_S0400_G0010_001_terminalR=Damage reports from the great war are too many and information is complicated.
M6150_S0410_G0010_001_terminalR=The damage due to Plato 1728's rampage is big, but it will likely become very precious data.
M6150_S0410_G0020_001_terminalR=If we could manipulate that berserk state at will, the annihilation of that YoRHa squad is not a dream.
M6150_S0420_G0010_001_terminalR=I thought about converting to combat type, but I saw the report on the great war and quit.
M6150_S0420_G0020_001_terminalR=It's tiring, but it's much better than being destroyed right.
M6150_S0430_G0010_001_terminalR=Hello, can you hear me?
M6150_S0430_G0020_001_terminalR=......No good, can't make contact with this squad either. Just how many years has it been since this much damage occurred?
M6150_S0440_G0020_001_terminalR=Due to Plato 1728 rampage, damage to both enemy and ally is enormous, nothing remains in the vicinity.
M6150_S0440_G0030_001_terminalR=Various information is complicated too, and I don't get what is what at all.
M6150_S0441_G0010_001_terminalR=3rd Flight Battalion will head to the rampage site from here, and perform search for survivors and collection of information.
M6150_S0442_G0010_001_terminalR=Because that piece of junk went berserk, work increased, shit.
M6150_S0460_G0020_001_terminalR=Plato 1728's rampage, surely does the responsibility lie with him?
M6150_S0460_G0030_001_terminalR=No matter what I can't think he is bad.\nWhat on earth was the primary factor that made him go berserk......
M6150_S0460_G0040_001_terminalR=It looks like everyone is turning their eyes away from this fact.
M6150_S0470_G0010_001_terminalR=YoRHa squad...... As expected the damage by those guys in this great war too is enormous......
M6150_S0480_G0010_001_terminalR=Just how many lives were lost in this combat......
M6150_S0480_G0020_001_terminalR=Is there no road to peace...... Sorry, slip of the tongue.
M6150_S0490_G0020_001_terminalR=Because there was a great war, deserters have surged.
M6150_S0490_G0030_001_terminalR=Compiling the member roster is a struggle too, I wish they'd report when they desert, good grief.
M6150_S0500_G0010_001_terminalR=Hum, just how can we decrease deserters?
M6150_S0500_G0020_001_terminalR=That's it! Let's increase the workload, and decrease the time to desert or think!!
M6150_S0520_G0010_001_terminalR=..............................There is no time to move my mouth......
M6150_S0530_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently my friend is hooked on something called Religion.
M6150_S0530_G0020_001_terminalR=Maybe I'll try taking a lecture together next time.
M6150_S0540_G0010_001_terminalR=I hated the stagnant air here before, but now I've come full circle, and come to like this air.
M6150_S0550_G0020_001_terminalR=Honestly the war situation lately is not good, have to find the enemy base quickly.
M6150_S0560_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently long ago they collected information with things called Spies, but Androids and Machine Lifeforms differ too much in appearance, so we can't send Spies in.
M6150_S0565_G0010_001_terminalR=Apparently in another district something called Religion is popular.\nI hear there is someone called a Founder, one chosen by God.
M6150_S0570_G0020_001_terminalR=Those anti-war faction guys. To spread solicitation activities using the combat the other day as a reason.
M6150_S0570_G0030_001_terminalR=Joining hands with devil Androids etc, makes me want to vomit.
M6150_S0580_G0010_001_terminalR=Only when work is finally about to end, the terminal freezes.
M6150_S0590_G0010_001_terminalR=I heard something called Religion is becoming popular.
M6150_S0590_G0020_001_terminalR=I hear if you join Religion, peaceful and happy days are promised for all eternity.
M6150_S0600_G0010_001_terminalR=Phew, ah good work.\nHow many days continuously have you pulled all-nighters as of today?
M6150_S0600_G0020_001_terminalR=Fufun, I haven't rested for 6 days as of today.\nHow is it, amazing right. No well, as expected I'm tired.
M6150_S0610_G0010_001_terminalR=I learned by investigating past literature, but apparently there was a worker's weapon called Overtime Pay. Also there are weapons like Strikes and Paid Leave.
M6150_S0610_G0020_001_terminalR=I hear workers possessing these were promised victory.\nI wonder how we can obtain them.
M6150_S0620_G0020_001_terminalR=Guys complaining about work will complain in the end no matter what they do, no matter where they are.
M6150_S0620_G0030_001_terminalR=In the end, it means the state of your own feelings is what's important.
M6150_S0630_G0010_001_terminalR=Because I'm operating for a long time, both my core and the terminal have incredible heat built up.
M6150_S0630_G0020_001_terminalR=This is the secret technique Double Heating Over!!
M6150_S0640_G0020_001_bossR2=Haa, you were talking that big to me until just the other day weren't you.
M6150_S0640_G0030_001_bossR2=Well it's fine. There's still 20 hours until starting time tomorrow isn't there.
M6150_S0650_G0020_001_subordinateR2=I am terribly sorry. With this workload it doesn't seem likely to make it in time within today.
M6150_S0650_G0030_001_subordinateR2=I'm sorry, I'm sorry, at that time I was getting carried away.
M6150_S0655_G0010_001_lookR=The guys next to me, the guy who was the boss until a little while ago made a mistake, and the relationship of boss and subordinate reversed.
M6150_S0655_G0020_001_lookR=Even though the former subordinate guy hated the boss that much, this time he is doing the same thing.
M6150_S0655_G0030_001_lookR=Perhaps individual personality is not something born with, but something given by power.
M6150_S0670_G0010_001_loafR2=This is the optimum slacking point!
M6150_S0680_G0010_001_putR=Ah, because there is a guy who dirties it immediately even if I tidy up, the room never gets clean, seriously pissing me off! Why can't they organize and tidy up!!
M6150_S0680_G0020_001_putR=Maybe I'll just sweep the things in the room away without asking on the next material collection day......
M6150_S0690_G0010_001_putR=Maybe I'll modify my body for material transport.
M6150_S0700_G0010_001_loafR2=The trick to pretending to work is the face!!\nIf you make a face like you are thinking hard, usually it works out somehow!!
M6150_S0710_G0010_001_loafR2=Too tired I see something. I see, did I finally arrive at the Truth!!
M6150_S0720_G0010_001_restR=Don't want to work. Don't want to work. Don't want to work. Don't want to work. Don't want to work. Don't want to work.
M6150_S0730_G0000_001_teruterubozu=......
M6150_S0730_G0010_001_attractR=......
M6150_S0740_G0010_001_frightenedR=................
