M1080_S0030_G0000_300_pascal=2B-san, where are you going? The Machine Lifeforms \nwho want to form an alliance are inside the Abandoned Factory.
M1080_S0030_G0480_101_pascal=The Machine Lifeforms wishing to form an alliance seem to be in the back.
M1080_S0030_G0490_101_pascal=However, please be careful.
M1080_S0030_G0500_101_pascal=We Machine Lifeforms are dangerous, after all.
M1080_S0030_G0510_101_a2b=You guys are... dangerous?
M1080_S0030_G0520_101_pascal=Yes, it is an objective fact.
M1080_S0030_G0530_101_pascal=Disconnected from the network, we do not share each other's information.
M1080_S0030_G0540_101_pascal=Even if we exchange words, they might differ from true intentions.
M1080_S0030_G0550_101_a2b=...Words, huh.
M1080_S0040_S0000_101_n02=Welcome. To the place where God dwells.
M1080_S0050_G0000_101_n02=We have realized the existence of God.
M1080_S0050_G0010_101_n02=Under the name of God, all existence must be equal.
M1080_S0050_G0020_101_n02=The Founder wishes to conclude a peace treaty with you.
M1080_S0050_G0030_101_n02=We priests shall guide you. To the room in the back, please.
M1080_S0050_G0040_101_pascal=As predicted, a very suspicious group...
M1080_S0050_G0050_101_a2b=Then why did you come along?
M1080_S0050_G0050_300_n02=Please stop!! We have no intention of fighting!!
M1080_S0050_G0060_101_pascal=Since I introduced this place to you, 2B-san...
M1080_S0050_G0060_300_pascal=Please calm down! We came here for peace negotiations...
M1080_S0050_G0070_101_pascal=I have a responsibility to see this through with you.
M1080_S0050_G0080_101_a2b=...I am grateful, for what it's worth.
M1080_S0050_G0090_101_prst=Please proceed along this passageway.
M1080_S0050_G0100_101_prst=To go to the Founder's room, please take this elevator.
M1080_S0050_G0100_300_pascal=Let's at least listen to what they have to say.
M1080_S0050_G0111_101_prst=Even if you hurry so much, the Founder won't run away.
