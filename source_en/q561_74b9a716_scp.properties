M5561_S0010_G0000_001_ppl=Oh, welcome.
M5561_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=I'd love to chat, but I have to run an errand.
M5561_S0010_G0020_001_ppl=Sorry for the rush. We suddenly need some materials.
M5561_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=Ah, that's it! Why don't we ask this one? Huh?
M5561_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Asking me? To gather materials?
M5561_S0010_G0050_001_a2=Another material gathering job?
M5561_S0010_G0060_001_ppl=Oh no, that would be imposing...
M5561_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Go gather materials.
M5561_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Do not go.
M5561_S0010_G0090_001_dbl=Aw, man... It's tough sending Popola out to gather dangerous materials...
M5561_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=I'd really like to ask you for this one...
M5561_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=Please, just this once, for my sake! I'm begging you!
M5561_S0010_G0120_001_dbl=Man, you're a real lifesaver!
M5561_S0010_G0130_001_ppl=Devola, asking the impossible again...
M5561_S0010_G0140_001_dbl=Well, it's fine, isn't it? Let's just accept the kindness here.
M5561_S0010_G0150_001_dbl=Sorry about this, but could you go get some "Desert Roses" for us?
M5561_S0010_G0160_001_dbl="Desert Roses" are rare materials that can only be found in small quantities in the old ruins buried in the desert.
M5561_S0010_G0170_001_ppl=...I'm sorry for the unreasonable request. There are many enemies in the desert, so please be careful.
M5561_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=So this is around where Devola and Popola said the "Desert Roses" would be.
M5561_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=It's a real pain to come all the way out here just to gather things.
M5561_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Why are those two doing such difficult work...?
M5561_S0020_G0030_001_a2=So this is around where the twins said the "Desert Roses" are. It's a real pain to come gather them.
M5561_S0020_G0040_001_a2=...Why are those two doing such difficult work?
M5561_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=This should be enough "Desert Roses." Let's head back to Devola and Popola.
M5561_S0020_G0060_001_a2=This should be enough "Desert Roses." Let's head back to those two.
M5561_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=Thank you! This many "Desert Roses" is plenty.
M5561_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=I'm sorry for asking the impossible. But you really helped us out.
M5561_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=They're constantly being made to do such grueling labor...
M5561_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis: Grueling tasks will eventually have a negative impact on the organization.
M5561_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=I'm going to go talk to Anemone-san for a bit.
M5561_S0030_G0050_001_a2=I don't like this. Why are only those twins being made to do such hard labor?
M5561_S0030_G0060_001_pod042=Hypothesis: Grueling tasks will eventually have a negative impact on the organization.
M5561_S0030_G0070_001_a2=I should probably have a word with the leader here...
M5561_S0030_G0080_001_ane=What's wrong? You look upset.
M5561_S0030_G0090_001_ane=...Ah, it's about Devola and Popola.
M5561_S0030_G0100_001_ane=It's true that we give them all the difficult jobs. It's only natural to call that irrational.
M5561_S0030_G0110_001_ane=However, there's nothing I can do about it on my own.
M5561_S0030_G0120_001_ane=...The others around here still haven't forgiven them.
M5561_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Forgiven them? For what?
M5561_S0030_G0140_001_a2=Forgiven? What do you mean? What in the world are those two...?
M5561_S0030_G0150_001_ane=That's...
M5561_S0030_G0160_001_ane=Someday, you should hear it from them yourselves.
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Yo, see anything you like?
