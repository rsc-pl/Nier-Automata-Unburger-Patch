M5290_S0010_G0000_001_robocreator=Hey there! Are ya having fun?
M5290_S0010_G0000_300_robocreator=Will you help me out?
M5290_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=In a place like this? There's no way I could be having fun.
M5290_S0010_G0010_300_sele=Cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0020_001_robocreator=Yeah, I knooow. It's an Amusement Park, but there's nothing decent to play wiiiith.
M5290_S0010_G0020_300_sele=Do not cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0030_001_robocreator=So, I'm thinking of making a game!
M5290_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Huh? A game?
M5290_S0010_G0050_001_robocreator=Yup! A fun game that everyone can play. But I just don't have enough materiaaaals~
M5290_S0010_G0060_001_robocreator=Which is why I'm askin', won't you help me out a little?
M5290_S0010_G0070_001_sele=I'll cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0080_001_sele=I won't cooperate.
M5290_S0010_G0090_001_robocreator=Thank you! The material I need is a "Tri-color Cable." I'm counting on yoooou~
M5290_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=If you know what materials you need, why don't you gather them yourself?
M5290_S0010_G0110_001_robocreator=You can get "Tri-color Cables" from the Machine Lifeforms here in the Amusement Park, but I really don't like killing my comraaaades!
M5290_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Then you should just give up on making a game.
M5290_S0010_G0130_001_robocreator=For the sake of Creation, one must not be picky about the means!
M5290_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=You're contradicting yourself...
M5290_S0010_G0150_001_robocreator=I want to make a game everyone can play. So, won't you help me gather the materials?
M5290_S0020_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! A "Tri-color Cable." Are you giving this to me?
M5290_S0020_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, just wait a sec. If I connect this...
M5290_S0020_G0020_001_robocreator=See! Now you can play the gaaame~
M5290_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Oh? What kind of game is it?
M5290_S0020_G0040_001_robocreator=It's a shooting game. But, I feel like there might be some buuuugs...
M5290_S0020_G0041_001_robocreator=Wanna go play the game?
M5290_S0020_G0042_001_sele=Play.
M5290_S0020_G0043_001_sele=Do not play.
M5290_S0020_G0044_001_robocreator=If possible, while you're playing, I'd like you to debug it for me.
M5290_S0020_G0050_001_robocreator=Congrats on clearing it! Did you have fun?
M5290_S0020_G0051_001_robocreator=You found a bug! Thank you!
M5290_S0020_G0060_001_robocreator=But honestly, I want to make a game with a higher difficulty.
M5290_S0020_G0070_001_robocreator=Which is why, this time, I was wondering if you could bring me a "Four-color Cable"?
M5290_S0020_G0071_001_robocreator=My passion... it's gushing forth... The passion to create an even more wonderful game...
M5290_S0020_G0072_001_robocreator=So, could you bring a "Four-color Cable" to me, a me who is filled with such enthusiasm?
M5290_S0020_G0080_001_sele=I'll bring it.
M5290_S0020_G0080_300_robocreator=Enjoy the game!
M5290_S0020_G0090_001_sele=I won't bring it.
M5290_S0020_G0090_300_robocreator=Come back anytime you want to play a game!
M5290_S0020_G0100_001_robocreator=Xie xie! If I recall, a Machine Lifeform in the Abandoned Factory had a "Four-color Cable"...
M5290_S0020_G0101_300_robocreator=It was a weird one that was walking away from its comrades.
M5290_S0020_G0110_001_robocreator=Well then, I'm counting on yoooou~
M5290_S0020_G0120_001_robocreator=I want to make a slightly more difficult game, so could you bring me a "Four-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0020_G0120_300_robocreator=I can't enjoy Creation in this state... Please do something!
M5290_S0020_G0122_300_robocreator=The one with the "Tri-color Cable" is aggressive, so be careful!
M5290_S0020_G0130_001_robocreator=Xie xie! If I recall, a Machine Lifeform in the Abandoned Factory had a "Four-color Cable"...
M5290_S0020_G0131_300_robocreator=It was a weird one that was walking away from its comrades.
M5290_S0030_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! A "Four-color Cable." Are you giving this to me?
M5290_S0030_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, just wait a sec. Connecting this...
M5290_S0030_G0020_001_robocreator=Okay! The difficulty has gone up a little!
M5290_S0030_G0030_001_robocreator=There's a reward if you find a bug, so please try playing iiiit~
M5290_S0030_G0031_001_robocreator=Did you enjoy yourself?
M5290_S0030_G0032_001_robocreator=Thanks for finding the bug!
M5290_S0030_G0040_001_robocreator=But honestly, I want to make a game with an even higher difficulty. I want to target heavy users.
M5290_S0030_G0050_001_robocreator=Which is why, I was wondering if you could bring me a "Five-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0030_G0051_001_robocreator=I want to make an interesting game and become a first-class creator... I want it so bad!
M5290_S0030_G0052_001_robocreator=So, could you bring a "Five-color Cable" to me, a me who is filled with such enthusiasm?
M5290_S0030_G0060_001_sele=I'll bring it.
M5290_S0030_G0070_001_sele=I won't bring it.
M5290_S0030_G0080_001_robocreator=Spasibo! Well then, I'm counting on you for that "Five-color Cable"~
M5290_S0030_G0090_001_robocreator=You can get it from the Machine Lifeforms in the desert~
M5290_S0030_G0091_300_robocreator=It's mixed in with the herd, so do your best to find it!
M5290_S0030_G0100_001_a9s="Get it"... Aren't they your comrades?
M5290_S0030_G0110_001_robocreator=Long live Creation!
M5290_S0030_G0120_001_robocreator=I want to make a difficult game for heavy users, so could you bring me a "Five-color Cable" again?
M5290_S0030_G0130_001_robocreator=A Machine Lifeform in the desert has the "Five-color Cable"~
M5290_S0030_G0131_300_robocreator=It's mixed in with the herd, so do your best to find it!
M5290_S0040_G0000_001_robocreator=Oh! A "Five-color Cable." Are you giving this to me?
M5290_S0040_G0010_001_robocreator=Alright, just wait a sec. Connecting this...
M5290_S0040_G0020_001_robocreator=Good! It's become so difficult, I doubt you can even debug it!
M5290_S0040_G0030_001_robocreator=There's a reward if you find a bug, so try playing iiiit~
M5290_S0040_G0031_001_robocreator=Fufufu... Wasn't it difficult?
M5290_S0040_G0032_001_robocreator=Even though it was so hard, I'm grateful you found the bug!
M5290_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=You're not going to make another game?
M5290_S0040_G0070_001_robocreator=Uuugh... Actually, I'm out of ideas.
M5290_S0040_G0080_001_robocreator=I have come to realize that Creation is not so simple...
M5290_S0040_G0090_001_robocreator=And with that, I shall retire.
M5290_S0040_G0100_001_robocreator=Thank you very much.
M5920_S0020_G0240_001_pod153=Requested materials obtained.
